======================================================================

SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are an expert mathematics problem solver. Provide clear, step-by-step reasoning.

USER PROMPT:

Solve this AIME problem. First explain your reasoning, then give the answer.

Problem: In $\triangle ABC$ with $AB=AC,$ point $D$ lies strictly between $A$ and $C$ on side $\overline{AC},$ and point $E$ lies strictly between $A$ and $B$ on side $\overline{AB}$ such that $AE=ED=DB=BC.$ The degree measure of $\angle ABC$ is $\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$ 

Instructions:
1. REASONING: Explain your approach, key insights, and solution steps
2. ANSWER: Provide only the final numerical answer (integer between 0-999)

Format your response exactly as:

REASONING:
[Your detailed thought process and solution steps]

ANSWER: [just the number]
