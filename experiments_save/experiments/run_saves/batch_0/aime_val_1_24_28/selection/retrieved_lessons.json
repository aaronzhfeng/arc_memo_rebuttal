Multiply the counts for independent partitions to get the total number of arrangements.\n- situation: When asked for the probability of a certain arrangement among all possible arrangements of colored or labeled objects, especially when there are repeated objects.\n  suggestion: Compute the total number of arrangements by dividing the factorial of the total number of positions by the product of factorials for each set of indistinguishable objects. Then, count the number of favorable arrangements using the specific constraints, and form the probability as a ratio.\n- situation: When a combinatorial constraint is difficult to count directly for all objects at once.\n  suggestion: Look for ways to rephrase the constraint in terms of independent choices for each object or group (such as assigning each color to odd/even positions), which can simplify the counting using basic combinatorial principles.\n- situation: When the puzzle involves arrangements or seatings around a circle, but the constraint or question is symmetric under relabeling (e.g., all spots are distinguishable or the arrangement is considered up to rotation).\n  suggestion: Consider fixing the labeling of the spots (treating them as linearly ordered or numbered) to simplify the counting, unless the problem explicitly requires accounting for rotational symmetry. This often allows you to use straightforward factorial counts.","2025_II_12":"- situation: When you need to relate side lengths and angles in a triangle, especially with a known point inside and some given distances or angles.\n  suggestion: Draw and label all relevant angles, then use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in the appropriate subtriangle(s) to set up equations connecting the unknowns.\n- situation: When you have multiple unknowns involving triangle side lengths, angles, and the circumradius, especially when expressions involve sines and cosines of the triangle's angles.\n  suggestion: Use the Law of Sines and known trigonometric identities (such as sin²A + sin²B + sin²C = 2 + 2 cosA cosB cosC) to reduce the number of variables, ideally to a single variable (like the circumradius), and solve the resulting equation.\n- situation: When the problem data is symmetric or involves isosceles or other special triangles, and you need to compute trigonometric values of certain angles.\n  suggestion: Apply the Law of Cosines in the relevant triangle to compute cosines of key angles directly from side lengths, and use these to simplify subsequent trigonometric expressions.\n- situation: When a geometric problem leads to an algebraic expression involving square roots or rational numbers, and the answer is requested in a specific form (such as m/n for relatively prime integers).\n  suggestion: Express the answer in the required form by rationalizing denominators and ensuring the result is fully simplified, then check for relative primality as needed.\n- situation: When the problem asks for a final answer in the form of a reduced fraction m/n and then for m+n.\n  suggestion: After computing the required value, always simplify the fraction to lowest terms before extracting m and n, and then sum them as requested.","2025_II_13":"- situation: When you encounter a recurrence relation involving rational functions (fractions) of previous terms, especially with small integer initial conditions.\n  suggestion: Compute the first several terms explicitly, simplifying at each step, to look for repeating patterns or periodicity. Such recurrences often become periodic after a few steps.\n- situation: When a sequence appears complicated due to fractions or large numbers, but the problem asks for a term with a very large index (like tₙ for large n).\n  suggestion: Check for cycles or periodicity in the sequence, as this can reduce the problem to a much smaller computation (e.g., using n mod period).\n- situation: When working with recursive sequences that produce fractions, and you need to identify a term in lowest terms or sum numerator and denominator.\n  suggestion: At each step, reduce fractions to lowest terms by cancelling common factors. This keeps calculations manageable and ensures you can answer questions about numerators and denominators directly.\n- situation: When a recurrence relation looks intimidating or complex, and standard approaches (like generating functions) seem unwieldy.\n  suggestion: Try direct computation of initial terms to seek patterns, rather than immediately reaching for advanced techniques. Many contest problems are designed to reward pattern-spotting and clever computation over brute-force algebra.\n- situation: When the final answer is a probability that must be expressed as a reduced fraction or in a particular form (like p + q for p/q in lowest terms).\n  suggestion: After calculating the probability, reduce the fraction to lowest terms and follow any specific formatting instructions for the answer.","2025_II_14":"- situation: When a geometric figure (such as a trapezoid or triangle) has parallel sides or other symmetries, and you need to assign coordinates to its vertices for further calculation.\n  suggestion: Choose a coordinate system that aligns the figure's key features (e.g., make parallel sides horizontal or vertical, place a vertex at the origin) to simplify equations and calculations involving distances and slopes.\n- situation: When working with polygons or figures with given side lengths and parallel sides, and you need to solve for unknown coordinates.\n  suggestion: Set up equations based on the distance formula for the given side lengths, and use properties like parallelism to relate coordinates, then solve the resulting system for the unknowns.\n- situation: When a geometric figure is described with symmetry (such as isosceles trapezoids, rectangles, or figures with parallel sides) and you are given distances from a point to lines or sides.\n  suggestion: Place the figure in a coordinate system that aligns axes with axes of symmetry or parallel sides, centering or anchoring key points at the origin or along axes to simplify calculations and exploit symmetry.\n- situation: When the problem involves calculating the area of a symmetric quadrilateral (like a trapezoid) after finding the coordinates of its vertices.\n  suggestion: Use the standard area formula for the figure (e.g., for a trapezoid, area = average of bases × height), substituting the expressions for the lengths and height derived from your coordinate setup.\n- situation: When the final answer involves a product or function of the area and a radical (like √2·K), and your area expression contains that radical.\n  suggestion: Delay numerical simplification until the last step, and look for cancellations or simplifications when multiplying by the radical, to avoid unnecessary complexity.","2025_II_15":"- situation: When you encounter a system of equations that is fully symmetric in several variables (i.e., the equations remain unchanged under permutations of the variables).\n  suggestion: First, consider the possibility that all variables are equal, as symmetric systems often have such solutions. Substitute this assumption into the equations to check for possible solutions.\n- situation: When the system is symmetric and you want to find all solutions, not just the fully symmetric ones.\n  suggestion: Try subtracting pairs of equations to eliminate terms and look for factorizations. This can reveal constraints such as 'either two variables are equal or one variable equals a special value,' which can reduce the system to simpler cases.\n- situation: When subtracting symmetric equations leads to a product of factors equaling zero (e.g., (x−z)(y−4)=0).\n  suggestion: Interpret the factorization as indicating multiple cases: either variables are equal, or one variable takes a special value. Analyze each case separately to find all possible solutions.\n- situation: When the problem asks for all possible values of a variable from a symmetric system, possibly with further operations (like summing squares).\n  suggestion: After finding all cases and all possible values, ensure to collect all distinct values (considering symmetry), and then apply the requested operation (e.g., sum of squares) to the complete set.\n- situation: When the problem asks for a sum or aggregate of certain terms from all valid sequences found.\n  suggestion: After finding all valid sequences, extract the required terms and perform the final calculation as specified by the problem."}
