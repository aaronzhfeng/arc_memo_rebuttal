involved.\"\n\n- situation: \"When you encounter expressions involving powers of two algebraic conjugates (like αⁿ + βⁿ, where α and β are roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients).\"\n  suggestion: \"Recognize that such expressions often satisfy linear recurrences with integer coefficients, and use the minimal polynomial or Newton's identities to prove integrality and find recurrence relations for the sequence.\"\n\n- situation: \"When a sequence defined by a recurrence or by expressions involving radicals is known to always be integer-valued, and you are asked about the behavior of its last digit or residues modulo some integer.\"\n  suggestion: \"Compute the sequence modulo the given modulus for enough terms to detect periodicity, then use the period to count occurrences or analyze the distribution of residues over a large range.\"\n\n- situation: \"When you need to count how often a certain residue or property appears in a periodic sequence over a long interval.\"\n  suggestion: \"Determine the period and the frequency of the desired property within one period, then scale up by the number of complete periods in your interval and adjust for any partial period at the end.\"\n```"],["```yaml\n- situation: \"When a problem involves finding the least positive multiple of an integer that is congruent to 1 modulo a sequence of increasing powers of a prime (e.g., 2ⁿ), or more generally, solving for modular inverses as the modulus increases.\"\n  suggestion: \"Reformulate the problem in terms of modular inverses, and recognize that the sequence of inverses modulo pⁿ can be understood via lifting (e.g., Hensel's lemma) and is related to the base-p (here, binary) expansion of the p-adic inverse.\"\n\n- situation: \"When you need to analyze how a solution or property changes as you increase the modulus from pⁿ to pⁿ⁺¹, especially for modular inverses or similar recursive constructions.\"\n  suggestion: \"Track how the solution 'lifts' from one modulus to the next, often by considering the carry or adjustment needed at each step. This process often corresponds to reading off the digits in the p-adic expansion of a rational number.\"\n\n- situation: \"When the sequence of digits (or bits) in a p-adic expansion is relevant, and the rational number involved has a periodic p-adic expansion.\"\n  suggestion: \"Compute the period of the expansion by finding the multiplicative order of the base modulo the modulus, then use this periodicity to count or analyze properties over large ranges by working within one period and scaling up.\"\n\n- situation: \"When a counting problem reduces to tallying the number of times a certain digit (e.g., 0) appears in the periodic expansion of a rational number in base p.\"\n  suggestion: \"Compute the expansion for one full period, count the desired digits within that period, and then multiply by the number of complete periods in your range, adding any remainder as needed.\"\n\n- situation: \"When a problem seems complicated by increasing modulus or recursive structure, but the underlying arithmetic is rational and periodic in nature.\"\n  suggestion: \"Look for periodicity or repeating patterns in the relevant expansions or sequences, and exploit this structure to simplify counting or analysis over large ranges.\"\n```"]]
