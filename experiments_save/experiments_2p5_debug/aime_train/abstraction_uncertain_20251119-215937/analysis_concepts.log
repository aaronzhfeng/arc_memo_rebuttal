Model output: ['```yaml\n- situation: "When a geometric configuration involves multiple segments of equal, unknown length (say, \'s\') connecting vertices and interior points, leading to several isosceles triangles."\n  suggestion: "Assign variables to the unknown angles at the vertices of the main figure. Use the Isosceles Triangle Theorem (base angles are equal) repeatedly on each derived isosceles triangle to express all interior angles in terms of the initial variables."\n- situation: "When angles around a point or along a straight line must sum to $180^\\circ$, and the angles are expressed in terms of a few primary variables ($\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$)."\n  suggestion: "Set up an equation by summing the angles that form a straight line or a full circle. If the configuration involves a cevian dividing an angle, check if the angles on one side of the cevian sum to the angle on the other side, or if they sum to $180^\\circ$ along the line containing the cevian\'s endpoint."\n- situation: "When a system of linear equations involving angles derived from geometric constraints results in a solution that is a rational multiple of $180^\\circ$ (or $\\pi$ radians)."\n  suggestion: "If the system is underdetermined or appears complex, look for a relationship that forces a linear combination of the variables to zero (e.g., $\\alpha + \\beta - 2\\gamma = 0$). Use this derived relationship along with the primary constraint (e.g., $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$) to eliminate variables and solve for the required angle."\n- situation: "When a geometric setup forces a specific angle $\\beta$ to be greater than $60^\\circ$ (e.g., $\\beta > 180^\\circ - 2\\beta$ or $\\beta > 180^\\circ - 3\\beta$)."\n  suggestion: "Calculate the resulting angle expression (e.g., $3\\beta - 180^\\circ$) and use it as a check. If the calculation yields a positive angle, the geometric ordering assumed (which led to the expression) is likely correct. If it yields a negative or zero angle, re-examine the collinearity or angle addition assumptions."\n```']
