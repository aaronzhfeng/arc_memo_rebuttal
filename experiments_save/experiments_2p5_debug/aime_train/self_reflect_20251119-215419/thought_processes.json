{"2020-I-1":"The previous attempt successfully identified the key geometric relationships derived from the equal side lengths, leading to a system of linear equations for the angles $\\alpha = \\angle BAC$ and $\\beta = \\angle ABC$.\n\n### Review and Verification of Steps\n\n1.  **Setup:** Let $\\alpha = \\angle BAC$ and $\\beta = \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB$. We have $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$. Let $s$ be the common length $AE=ED=DB=BC=s$.\n\n2.  **Isosceles Triangle $\\triangle ADE$ ($AE=ED=s$):**\n    The angles opposite the equal sides must be equal. The angle opposite $AE$ is $\\angle ADE$. The angle opposite $ED$ is $\\angle DAE = \\alpha$.\n    Therefore, $\\angle ADE = \\alpha$. (This step was correctly identified in the previous attempt, although the initial reasoning about base angles was slightly confused before correction: \"If $AE=ED$, then the angles opposite these sides are equal: $\\angle ADE = \\angle DAE$.\" This is correct.)\n\n3.  **Isosceles Triangle $\\triangle DBC$ ($DB=BC=s$):**\n    The angles opposite the equal sides are $\\angle BDC$ (opposite $BC$) and $\\angle BCD = \\beta$ (opposite $DB$).\n    Therefore, $\\angle BDC = \\beta$. (Correct.)\n    This implies $\\angle DBC = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta$. (Correct.)\n\n4.  **Angles at Vertex B:**\n    Since $D$ is on $AC$, $BD$ is a cevian. $\\angle ABC = \\angle ABD + \\angle DBC$.\n    $\\beta = \\angle ABD + (180^\\circ - 2\\beta)$.\n    $\\angle ABD = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ$. (Correct, requiring $\\beta > 60^\\circ$).\n\n5.  **Isosceles Triangle $\\triangle EDB$ ($ED=DB=s$):**\n    Let $\\gamma = \\angle DBE = \\angle ABD = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ$.\n    The base angles are $\\angle DEB = \\angle DBE = \\gamma$.\n    The third angle is $\\angle EDB = 180^\\circ - 2\\gamma$. (Correct.)\n\n6.  **Angles on the line $AC$ at $D$:**\n    Since $A, D, C$ are collinear, $\\angle ADB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$.\n    Since $E$ lies on $AB$ and $D$ is on $AC$, the segment $DE$ lies between $DA$ and $DB$ relative to the line $AC$. Thus, $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADE + \\angle EDB$. (This geometric ordering assumption is crucial and appears sound given $E$ is on $AB$ and $D$ is on $AC$).\n    Combining these: $\\angle ADE + \\angle EDB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$. (Correct.)\n\n7.  **Solving the System:**\n    Substitute the expressions in terms of $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$:\n    $\\alpha + (180^\\circ - 2\\gamma) + \\beta = 180^\\circ$.\n    $\\alpha + \\beta - 2\\gamma = 0$. (Equation A)\n\n    Substitute $\\gamma = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ$:\n    $\\alpha + \\beta - 2(3\\beta - 180^\\circ) = 0$.\n    $\\alpha + \\beta - 6\\beta + 360^\\circ = 0$.\n    $\\alpha - 5\\beta = -360^\\circ$. (Equation B)\n\n    We use the main triangle relation: $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$. (Equation C)\n\n    Subtracting (B) from (C):\n    $(\\alpha + 2\\beta) - (\\alpha - 5\\beta) = 180^\\circ - (-360^\\circ)$.\n    $7\\beta = 540^\\circ$.\n    $\\beta = \\frac{540}{7}$ degrees.\n\n8.  **Final Calculation:**\n    The required angle is $\\angle ABC = \\beta = \\frac{540}{7}$.\n    $m=540$, $n=7$. They are coprime.\n    $m+n = 540 + 7 = 547$.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe logic flow is sound, and the derivation relies on standard geometric theorems applied correctly to the defined configuration. The initial uncertainty regarding the ordering of angles at $D$ was resolved by confirming the relationship $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADE + \\angle EDB$, which is consistent with the final solution satisfying all angle constraints. The solution is robust.\n\nThe final result is $\\beta = \\frac{540}{7}$. We seek $m+n$.\n\nThe improved thought process confirms the original derivation path was correct and rigorous."}
