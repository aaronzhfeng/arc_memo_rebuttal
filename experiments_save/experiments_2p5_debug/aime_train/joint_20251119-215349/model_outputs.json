[["Let $\\alpha$ be the measure of $\\angle BAC$. Since $AB=AC$, $\\triangle ABC$ is isosceles, so $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB$. Let $\\beta = \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB$.\nWe have $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$.\n\nWe are given the condition $AE=ED=DB=BC$. Let $s$ be this common length.\n$AE = ED = DB = BC = s$.\n\nSince $AE=ED=s$, $\\triangle ADE$ is isosceles.\nSince $ED=DB=s$, $\\triangle EDB$ is isosceles.\nSince $DB=BC=s$, $\\triangle DBC$ is isosceles.\n\nLet's analyze the angles based on these isosceles triangles.\n\n1. **In $\\triangle ADE$:** $AE=ED=s$.\n$\\angle EAD = \\angle BAC = \\alpha$.\nSince $AE=ED$, $\\angle ADE = \\angle DAE = \\alpha$. (Wait, this is incorrect. The base angles are opposite the equal sides. The equal sides are $AE$ and $ED$. The angle opposite $AE$ is $\\angle ADE$, and the angle opposite $ED$ is $\\angle EAD = \\alpha$. So, $\\angle ADE = \\angle DAE = \\alpha$ is only true if $AD=AE$, which is not given. The base angles are $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle DAE$ if $AE=ED$. No, the base is $AD$. The base angles are $\\angle EAD$ and $\\angle EDA$. If $AE=ED$, then the angles opposite these sides are equal: $\\angle ADE = \\angle DAE$. This is only true if $AD$ is the base. Let's re-examine the definition of base angles in an isosceles triangle. If two sides are equal, the angles opposite those sides are equal.)\n\nIn $\\triangle ADE$, $AE=ED=s$.\nThe angle opposite $AE$ is $\\angle ADE$.\nThe angle opposite $ED$ is $\\angle EAD = \\alpha$.\nTherefore, $\\angle ADE = \\angle EAD = \\alpha$.\n\nThe sum of angles in $\\triangle ADE$ is $180^\\circ$:\n$\\angle AED = 180^\\circ - (\\alpha + \\alpha) = 180^\\circ - 2\\alpha$.\n\n2. **Angles on the line segment $AC$:**\nPoint $D$ is on $AC$. $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle CDE$ are not necessarily supplementary unless $E, D, C$ are collinear, which they are not. $D$ is on $AC$. $A, D, C$ are collinear.\n$\\angle ADC = 180^\\circ$. This is not helpful.\nWe look at the angles around point $D$ on the line $AC$.\n$\\angle ADE$ is an angle inside $\\triangle ADE$.\n$\\angle CDE$ is an angle inside $\\triangle CDE$.\n\nSince $A, D, C$ are collinear, $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle CDE$ are not directly related unless we consider the line $AC$.\nHowever, $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle CDE$ are adjacent angles that form $\\angle ADC$, which is a straight angle if $E$ was on the line $AC$, but $E$ is not on $AC$.\n\nLet's use the fact that $D$ lies on $AC$. The angle $\\angle ADC$ is $180^\\circ$ if we consider the line $AC$.\nThe angles $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle CDE$ are adjacent angles that share the side $DE$. They do not form a straight line unless $A, D, C$ are the vertices of a triangle, which they are not. $A, D, C$ are collinear.\n\nConsider the angle $\\angle CDE$. We need to relate it to other angles.\n\n3. **In $\\triangle DBC$:** $DB=BC=s$.\n$\\angle DCB = \\angle ACB = \\beta$.\nSince $DB=BC$, the angles opposite these sides are equal: $\\angle BDC = \\angle BCD = \\beta$.\n\nThe third angle is $\\angle DBC = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta$.\n\n4. **Relating angles at $D$ on the line $AC$:**\nSince $A, D, C$ are collinear, the angles $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle CDE$ are adjacent angles that sum up to $\\angle ADC$. Wait, this is confusing. $D$ is a point on the segment $AC$. The angle formed by the line segment $AC$ at $D$ is $180^\\circ$.\nThe angles $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle CDE$ are adjacent angles that form the angle $\\angle ADC$. Since $A, D, C$ are collinear, $\\angle ADC = 180^\\circ$.\nThus, $\\angle ADE + \\angle CDE = 180^\\circ$.\n\nFrom step 1, $\\angle ADE = \\alpha$.\nFrom step 3, $\\angle BDC = \\beta$.\n\nWe need to relate $\\angle CDE$ to known angles.\nWe have $\\angle ADC = 180^\\circ$.\n$\\angle ADE + \\angle CDE = 180^\\circ$.\nSince $\\angle ADE = \\alpha$, we have $\\alpha + \\angle CDE = 180^\\circ$.\nThis implies $\\angle CDE = 180^\\circ - \\alpha$.\n\nWait, this seems too simple and might imply $E$ lies on the line $AC$, which is false since $E$ is on $AB$. Let's re-examine the geometry. $A, D, C$ are collinear. $D$ is between $A$ and $C$.\nThe angle formed by the line $AC$ at $D$ is a straight angle, $180^\\circ$.\nIf we consider the ray $DA$ and the ray $DC$, they form a straight line.\nThe angle $\\angle ADE$ is formed by segment $DE$ and ray $DA$.\nThe angle $\\angle CDE$ is formed by segment $DE$ and ray $DC$.\nSince $DA$ and $DC$ are opposite rays, $\\angle ADE + \\angle CDE = 180^\\circ$. This is correct.\n\nSo, $\\angle CDE = 180^\\circ - \\alpha$.\n\nNow consider the angles around $D$ again. We have $\\angle BDC = \\beta$.\nThe angle $\\angle BDC$ is formed by segments $DB$ and $DC$.\nThe angle $\\angle CDE$ is formed by segments $DE$ and $DC$.\nThe angle $\\angle BDE$ is formed by segments $DB$ and $DE$.\n\nWe must have $\\angle BDC = \\angle BDE + \\angle CDE$ OR $\\angle CDE = \\angle CDB + \\angle BDE$ OR $\\angle BDE = \\angle BDC + \\angle CDE$. We need to determine the configuration of $B, D, E$.\n\nLet's use the information from $\\triangle EDB$.\n5. **In $\\triangle EDB$:** $ED=DB=s$.\nThe base is $EB$. The base angles are $\\angle DEB$ and $\\angle DBE$.\n$\\angle DEB = \\angle DBE$.\n\nLet $\\gamma = \\angle DBE$. Then $\\angle DEB = \\gamma$.\nThe third angle is $\\angle EDB = 180^\\circ - 2\\gamma$.\n\n6. **Relating angles at $B$:**\n$\\angle ABC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle ABC = \\angle ABE + \\angle EBC$.\nSince $E$ is on $AB$, $\\angle ABE$ is not defined as a separate angle unless we consider $E$ as a point on the segment $AB$. $\\angle ABC$ is the angle at vertex $B$.\n$\\angle ABC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle ABC = \\angle DBC + \\angle ABD$. This is not helpful as $D$ is on $AC$.\n\n$\\angle ABC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle ABC = \\angle ABD + \\angle DBC$. This is only true if $D$ is inside $\\angle ABC$. $D$ is on $AC$, so $\\angle ABD$ is not a standard angle unless $B, D, C$ form a triangle, which they do.\n\nLet's look at the angles around $B$:\n$\\angle ABC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle DBC$ is part of $\\angle ABC$.\n$\\angle ABD$ is the angle between $AB$ and $BD$.\n\nWe know $\\angle DBC$ is not defined yet. We only know $\\angle BDC = \\beta$ from $\\triangle DBC$.\n\nLet's use the angles we found:\nIn $\\triangle DBC$: $\\angle BCD = \\beta$, $\\angle BDC = \\beta$, so $\\angle DBC = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta$.\n\nSince $E$ is on $AB$, $\\angle ABC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle ABC = \\angle ABD + \\angle DBC$. This is only true if $D$ is in the interior of $\\angle ABC$. Since $D$ is on $AC$, this is not the case. $A, B, C$ form the triangle. $D$ is on $AC$. $BD$ is a cevian.\n$\\angle ABC$ is the angle between $BA$ and $BC$.\n$\\angle ABC = \\angle ABD + \\angle DBC$ is incorrect. $\\angle ABC$ is the angle at vertex $B$.\n\nLet's look at the angles related to $B$:\n$\\angle ABC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle DBC = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta$.\n$\\angle ABD$ is the angle between $AB$ and $BD$.\nSince $D$ is on $AC$, $BD$ is a segment inside $\\triangle ABC$.\nThus, $\\angle ABC = \\angle ABD + \\angle DBC$.\n$\\beta = \\angle ABD + (180^\\circ - 2\\beta)$.\n$\\angle ABD = \\beta - (180^\\circ - 2\\beta) = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ$.\n\nSince $\\angle ABD$ must be positive, $3\\beta > 180^\\circ$, so $\\beta > 60^\\circ$.\nSince $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$, if $\\beta > 60^\\circ$, then $2\\beta > 120^\\circ$, so $\\alpha < 60^\\circ$. This is consistent.\n\nNow consider $\\triangle EDB$. We defined $\\gamma = \\angle DBE = \\angle DEB$.\nSince $E$ is on $AB$, $\\angle DBE$ is the same as $\\angle DBA$ or $\\angle ABD$.\nSo, $\\gamma = \\angle ABD = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ$.\n\nIn $\\triangle EDB$, the sum of angles is $180^\\circ$:\n$\\angle EDB + \\angle DBE + \\angle DEB = 180^\\circ$.\n$(180^\\circ - 2\\gamma) + \\gamma + \\gamma = 180^\\circ$. This is an identity, so it doesn't help determine $\\gamma$ or $\\beta$.\n\nWe must use the relationship between the angles at $D$.\nWe established:\n$\\angle ADE = \\alpha$.\n$\\angle CDE = 180^\\circ - \\alpha$.\n$\\angle BDC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle EDB = 180^\\circ - 2\\gamma = 180^\\circ - 2(3\\beta - 180^\\circ) = 180^\\circ - 6\\beta + 360^\\circ = 540^\\circ - 6\\beta$.\n\nWe need to determine the order of rays $DB, DE, DC$ around $D$.\n$A, D, C$ are collinear. $E$ is on $AB$. $B$ is the third vertex.\n\nSince $E$ is on $AB$, $DE$ is a segment connecting $D$ on $AC$ to $E$ on $AB$.\n$DB$ connects $D$ on $AC$ to $B$.\n\nConsider the angles formed by the rays originating from $D$: $DA, DC, DE, DB$.\n$DA$ and $DC$ are opposite rays.\n\nSince $E$ is on $AB$, $DE$ is \"between\" $DA$ and $DB$ in some sense, but we must be careful.\nLet's look at $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\triangle BDE$. They share side $DE$.\n\nSince $E$ is on $AB$, the angle $\\angle ADE$ and $\\angle BDE$ are adjacent angles that form $\\angle ADB$.\n$\\angle ADB = \\angle ADE + \\angle EDB$.\n\nAlso, since $A, D, C$ are collinear, $\\angle ADB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$.\n\nSo, $\\angle ADE + \\angle EDB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$.\n\nSubstitute the known angle measures in terms of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$\\angle ADE = \\alpha$.\n$\\angle BDC = \\beta$.\n$\\angle EDB = 540^\\circ - 6\\beta$.\n\n$\\alpha + (540^\\circ - 6\\beta) + \\beta = 180^\\circ$.\n$\\alpha - 5\\beta + 540^\\circ = 180^\\circ$.\n$\\alpha - 5\\beta = 180^\\circ - 540^\\circ = -360^\\circ$.\n$\\alpha = 5\\beta - 360^\\circ$. (Equation I)\n\nWe also have the constraint from $\\triangle ABC$:\n$\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$. (Equation II)\n\nWe have a system of two linear equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\nSubstitute $\\alpha$ from (I) into (II):\n$(5\\beta - 360^\\circ) + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$.\n$7\\beta = 180^\\circ + 360^\\circ = 540^\\circ$.\n$\\beta = \\frac{540}{7}$ degrees.\n\nLet's check if this yields a valid angle $\\alpha$.\n$\\alpha = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta = 180^\\circ - 2\\left(\\frac{540}{7}\\right) = 180^\\circ - \\frac{1080}{7} = \\frac{1260 - 1080}{7} = \\frac{180}{7}$ degrees.\n\nCheck with Equation (I):\n$5\\beta - 360^\\circ = 5\\left(\\frac{540}{7}\\right) - 360^\\circ = \\frac{2700}{7} - \\frac{2520}{7} = \\frac{180}{7}$.\nThis matches $\\alpha$. So the values are consistent.\n\nWe must ensure that all points $D$ and $E$ lie strictly between the vertices, and all angles are positive.\n$\\alpha = \\frac{180}{7} \\approx 25.7^\\circ > 0$.\n$\\beta = \\frac{540}{7} \\approx 77.1^\\circ > 0$.\n$2\\beta = \\frac{1080}{7} < 180^\\circ$, so $\\alpha > 0$. This is satisfied.\n\nWe need to check $\\gamma = \\angle ABD$.\n$\\gamma = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ = 3\\left(\\frac{540}{7}\\right) - 180^\\circ = \\frac{1620}{7} - \\frac{1260}{7} = \\frac{360}{7}$ degrees.\nSince $\\frac{360}{7} > 0$, $\\angle ABD$ is positive, so $E$ is strictly between $A$ and $B$.\n\nWe also need to check if $D$ is strictly between $A$ and $C$. This is guaranteed by the problem statement, but we should ensure the geometric configuration derived is valid.\n\nLet's check the angles at $D$ using these values.\n$\\alpha = 180/7$.\n$\\beta = 540/7$.\n$\\gamma = 360/7$.\n\n$\\angle ADE = \\alpha = 180/7$.\n$\\angle BDC = \\beta = 540/7$.\n$\\angle EDB = 540^\\circ - 6\\beta = 540 - 6(540/7) = 540(1 - 6/7) = 540/7$.\nWait, $\\angle EDB = 540/7$.\nLet's check the sum: $\\angle ADE + \\angle EDB + \\angle BDC = 180/7 + 540/7 + 540/7 = (180 + 1080)/7 = 1260/7 = 180^\\circ$.\nThis confirms the geometric assumption $\\angle ADB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$ and the derived relationship $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADE + \\angle EDB$.\n\nLet's check the isosceles triangle conditions:\n1. $\\triangle ADE$: $AE=ED$. $\\angle ADE = \\alpha$. $\\angle DAE = \\alpha$. This requires $\\angle ADE = \\angle DAE$.\nWe found $\\angle ADE = \\alpha$. Since $\\angle DAE = \\alpha$, this is satisfied.\n\n2. $\\triangle EDB$: $ED=DB$. $\\angle DBE = \\gamma$. $\\angle DEB = \\gamma$.\nWe found $\\angle DBE = \\gamma = 360/7$.\n$\\angle EDB = 540/7$.\n$\\angle DEB = 180^\\circ - (\\angle EDB + \\angle DBE) = 180^\\circ - (540/7 + 360/7) = 180^\\circ - 900/7 = (1260 - 900)/7 = 360/7$.\nSo $\\angle DEB = \\gamma$. This is satisfied.\n\n3. $\\triangle DBC$: $DB=BC$. $\\angle BCD = \\beta$. $\\angle BDC = \\beta$.\nWe found $\\angle BCD = \\beta = 540/7$.\nWe found $\\angle BDC = \\beta = 540/7$. This is satisfied.\n\n4. $\\triangle ABC$: $AB=AC$. $\\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = \\beta$.\n$\\angle ACB = \\beta = 540/7$. This is satisfied.\n\nThe required angle is $\\angle ABC = \\beta = \\frac{540}{7}$ degrees.\nThis is given as $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m=540$ and $n=7$.\n\nWe check if $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.\n$540 = 54 \\times 10 = 2^3 \\cdot 3^3 \\cdot 5$.\n$7$ is a prime number.\nSince 7 does not divide 540, $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime.\n\nWe need to find $m+n$.\n$m+n = 540 + 7 = 547$.\n\n---\nAlternative check using side lengths (optional, for robustness):\nLet $s=1$. $AE=ED=DB=BC=1$.\nIn $\\triangle DBC$, by the Law of Sines:\n$\\frac{DC}{\\sin(180-2\\beta)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\beta}$.\n$DC = \\frac{\\sin(2\\beta)}{\\sin\\beta} = \\frac{2\\sin\\beta\\cos\\beta}{\\sin\\beta} = 2\\cos\\beta$.\n\nIn $\\triangle ABC$, $AC = AB$. $AC = AD + DC$.\n$AB = AE + EB = s + EB = 1 + EB$.\n$AC = AD + 2\\cos\\beta$.\n\nIn $\\triangle ADE$, $AE=ED=1$. $AD$ is the base.\nBy Law of Sines: $\\frac{AD}{\\sin(180-2\\alpha)} = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\alpha}$.\n$AD = \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{\\sin\\alpha} = 2\\cos\\alpha$.\n\n$AC = 2\\cos\\alpha + 2\\cos\\beta$.\n\nIn $\\triangle ABC$, $AB=AC$.\n$AB = 2R \\sin\\beta$, $AC = 2R \\sin\\beta$. (Not helpful yet).\nUsing Law of Cosines on $BC=1$:\n$1^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2(AB)(AC)\\cos\\alpha$.\nSince $AB=AC$, let $L=AB=AC$.\n$1 = 2L^2 - 2L^2 \\cos\\alpha = 2L^2 (1 - \\cos\\alpha) = 2L^2 (2\\sin^2(\\alpha/2))$.\n$1 = 4L^2 \\sin^2(\\alpha/2)$.\n$L = \\frac{1}{2\\sin(\\alpha/2)}$.\n\nWe also have $L = AD + DC = 2\\cos\\alpha + 2\\cos\\beta$.\n$L = 2(\\cos\\alpha + \\cos\\beta)$.\n\nWe need to relate $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. $\\alpha = 180^\\circ - 2\\beta$.\n$\\cos\\alpha = \\cos(180^\\circ - 2\\beta) = -\\cos(2\\beta) = -(2\\cos^2\\beta - 1) = 1 - 2\\cos^2\\beta$.\n\n$L = 2(1 - 2\\cos^2\\beta + \\cos\\beta)$.\n\nThis seems much more complicated than the angle chasing approach, which yielded a unique solution based on the configuration derived from the angle sums. The angle chasing approach is generally preferred for such problems if the configuration is correctly identified.\n\nThe key steps were:\n1. Identifying all isosceles triangles based on $AE=ED=DB=BC=s$.\n2. Using $\\angle ADE = \\angle DAE = \\alpha$ in $\\triangle ADE$.\n3. Using $\\angle BDC = \\angle BCD = \\beta$ in $\\triangle DBC$.\n4. Relating angles at $B$: $\\angle ABD = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ = \\gamma$.\n5. Using $\\angle DEB = \\angle DBE = \\gamma$ in $\\triangle EDB$.\n6. Using the straight angle property at $D$ on $AC$: $\\angle ADB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$, and $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADE + \\angle EDB$.\n7. Solving the system of equations derived from angle sums:\n$\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$\n$\\alpha + (180^\\circ - 2\\gamma) + \\beta = 180^\\circ \\implies \\alpha - 2\\gamma + \\beta = 0$.\nSubstituting $\\gamma = 3\\beta - 180^\\circ$:\n$\\alpha - 2(3\\beta - 180^\\circ) + \\beta = 0$\n$\\alpha - 6\\beta + 360^\\circ + \\beta = 0$\n$\\alpha - 5\\beta = -360^\\circ$. (This matches Equation I derived earlier).\n\nSolving $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180$ and $\\alpha - 5\\beta = -360$ yields $\\beta = 540/7$.\n\n$m=540, n=7$. $m+n = 547$.\n\nFinal Answer: 547"]]
