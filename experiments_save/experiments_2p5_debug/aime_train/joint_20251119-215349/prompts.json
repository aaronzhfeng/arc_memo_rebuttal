["### Problem\nIn $\\triangle ABC$ with $AB=AC,$ point $D$ lies strictly between $A$ and $C$ on side $\\overline{AC},$ and point $E$ lies strictly between $A$ and $B$ on side $\\overline{AB}$ such that $AE=ED=DB=BC.$ The degree measure of $\\angle ABC$ is $\\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n\nProvide a detailed solution strategy. You may include short code snippets, equations, or checks if helpful.\nAfter you are fully satisfied with the reasoning, end with:\nFinal Answer: XYZ"]
