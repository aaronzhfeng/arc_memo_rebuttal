[["The user is asking to select 5 relevant geometry lessons for an AIME problem that is actually an algebra/rate problem involving time, distance, and speed.\n\nThe AIME problem structure is:\n1. Distance $D = 9$ km.\n2. Case 1: Speed $s$, Time $T_1 = 4$ hours. Stop time $t$ minutes.\n   Equation: $\\frac{9}{s} \\text{ hours} + \\frac{t}{60} \\text{ hours} = 4 \\text{ hours}$.\n3. Case 2: Speed $s+2$, Time $T_2 = 2$ hours 24 minutes $= 2 + \\frac{24}{60} = 2.4$ hours. Stop time $t$ minutes.\n   Equation: $\\frac{9}{s+2} \\text{ hours} + \\frac{t}{60} \\text{ hours} = 2.4 \\text{ hours}$.\n4. Goal: Find the time $T_3$ for speed $s + 1/2$, including $t$ minutes.\n   $T_3 = \\frac{9}{s + 1/2} \\text{ hours} + \\frac{t}{60} \\text{ hours}$.\n\nThis is purely an algebraic problem involving solving a system of two equations with two unknowns ($s$ and $t/60$ or $t$). The provided lessons are exclusively about **Geometry (specifically angle chasing in triangles)**.\n\nSince the problem domain (Algebra/Rate) does not match the lesson domain (Geometry), *none* of the lessons are structurally relevant to solving the core algebraic system.\n\nHowever, the instructions mandate choosing 5 lessons whose *situation* genuinely matches the math structure, or, if relevance is uncertain, choosing lessons that offer diagnostic checks. Since the structure is purely algebraic, and the lessons are purely geometric, the relevance is zero.\n\n**Constraint Check:** I must choose 5 lessons. If I cannot find 5 relevant lessons, I must select the ones that are *least* irrelevant or offer the most generic \"check\" if the problem *were* geometric, which is impossible here.\n\nGiven the strict instruction to choose lessons whose *situation* genuinely matches the math structure, and the math structure is entirely algebraic, I cannot fulfill the request based on the provided lessons.\n\n**Re-"]]
