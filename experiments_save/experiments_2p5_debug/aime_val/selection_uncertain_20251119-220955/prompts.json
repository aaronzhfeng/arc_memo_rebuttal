["### Context\nYou are selecting helper lessons for an AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) problem. AIME answers are three-digit integers (000–999). Typical domains include:\n- Algebra (equations, inequalities, polynomials, sequences, Vieta, functional relations)\n- Number theory (divisibility, primes, modular arithmetic, Diophantine equations, divisor/sum functions)\n- Combinatorics and probability (counting arguments, binomial identities, probability setups)\n- Geometry (plane geometry, circles, power of a point, occasional 3D configurations)\n\nOnly choose lessons whose situation genuinely matches the math structure of the given problem.\n\n### Task\nYou are given an AIME problem and a catalog of lessons. Each lesson has:\n- **situation** – when the lesson is applicable\n- **suggestion** – the recommended strategy or check\n\nChoose the 5 lessons whose situations *truly* match the structure of the\nproblem and whose suggestions would materially help reach the boxed integer\nanswer. Favor lessons that align with the problem’s mathematical domain and the\nspecific reasoning steps implied by the statement. Discard lessons that only\nvaguely relate. If relevance is uncertain, prefer lessons that offer diagnostic\nchecks (e.g., parity, modular sanity checks) to catch mistakes.\n\nReturn the lesson numbers in a YAML list, ordered by decreasing relevance.\n\n### Lessons\nlesson 1.\n- situation: When a configuration involves multiple segments of equal length connecting vertices and interior points of a triangle, suggesting a chain of isosceles triangles.\n- suggestion: Assign variables to the unknown angles ($\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\dots$) and systematically use the Isosceles Triangle Theorem (base angles are equal) on every triangle formed by the equal segments.\nlesson 2.\n- situation: When angles around a point or along a line segment must sum to $180^\\circ$ (straight line) or $360^\\circ$ (full circle), and these angles are composed of previously defined variables.\n- suggestion: Formulate linear equations relating the angle variables based on collinearity or angle addition postulates, ensuring the geometric ordering of rays is correctly represented.\nlesson 3.\n- situation: When the primary triangle angles are related by a simple sum constraint (e.g., $\\alpha + 2\\beta = 180^\\circ$) and the isosceles conditions yield a second, independent linear relationship between the same angles.\n- suggestion: Set up a system of two linear equations in two variables (the primary angles) and solve using elimination or substitution to find the exact angle measures.\nlesson 4.\n- situation: When an interior point $D$ lies on a side $AC$ of $\\triangle ABC$, and a segment $DE$ connects $D$ to a point $E$ on another side $AB$, leading to angle addition along the line $AC$.\n- suggestion: Verify the angle addition relationship: $\\angle ADB = \\angle ADE + \\angle EDB$ (or its complement if $E$ is positioned differently), and use the straight angle property $\\angle ADB + \\angle BDC = 180^\\circ$ to create a constraint equation involving all relevant angles.\n\n### AIME Problem\nLet $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\\omega$. Let the tangents to $\\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\\overline{AD}$ intersect $\\omega$ at $P$. If $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, $AP$ can be written as the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime integers. Find $m + n$.\n\n[asy] import olympiad;  unitsize(15);  pair A, B, C, D, E, F, P, O;  C = origin; A = (10,0); B = (7.8, 4.4899); draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(A..B..C..cycle, red+dotted);  O = circumcenter(A, B, C);  E = rotate(90,B) * (O); F = rotate(90,C) * (O);  D = IP(B..E + (B-E)*4, C..F + (C-F)*-3);  draw(B--D--C--D--A);  P = IP(D..A, A..B..C);  dot(A); dot(B); dot(C); dot(D); dot(P); label(\"$A$\", A, dir(335)); label(\"$B$\", B, dir(65)); label(\"$C$\", C, dir(200)); label(\"$D$\", D, dir(135)); label(\"$P$\", P, dir(235)); [/asy]\n"]
