[["The problem asks for the length $AP$ given the side lengths of $\\triangle ABC$ ($AB=5, BC=9, AC=10$) and a specific construction involving the circumcircle $\\omega$, tangents at $B$ and $C$ meeting at $D$, and the line segment $AD$ intersecting $\\omega$ at $P$.\n\nThis is a geometry problem heavily reliant on properties of circles, tangents, and secants. The key relationships likely involve the Power of a Point Theorem, properties of tangents, and possibly similar triangles derived from these properties.\n\nLet's analyze the structure and match it to the provided lessons:\n\n1.  **Lesson 1 (Isosceles Triangles/Equal Segments):** The problem involves side lengths and a circle, but the primary structure doesn't immediately suggest a chain of isosceles triangles based on equal segments connecting vertices and interior points. (Low relevance)\n2.  **Lesson 2 (Angles summing to $180^\\circ$ or $360^\\circ$):** While angle chasing is often useful in geometry, the core of this problem seems to rely on metric relations (lengths) derived from power theorems or similarity, rather than solving for specific angle values using linear systems. (Low relevance)\n3.  **Lesson 3 (System of linear equations for angles):** Similar to Lesson 2, this focuses on solving for angles, which is unlikely to be the primary path to finding the length $AP$. (Low relevance)\n4.  **Lesson 4 (Angle addition along a line segment):** This describes a specific configuration involving a point on a side, which does not match the setup involving the external point $D$ formed by tangents. (No relevance)\n\n**Re-evaluation based on the actual geometric structure:**\n\nThe problem requires finding a length $AP$ where $A, P$ are on the circle $\\omega$, and $D, P, A$ are collinear. This strongly suggests using the **Power of a Point Theorem** applied to point $D$ with respect to circle $\\omega$.\n\nSince $DB$ and $DC$ are tangents to $\\omega$ at $B$ and $C$, we have $DB = DC$.\nThe line $DPA$ is a secant intersecting $\\omega$ at $P$ and $A$.\nThe Power of Point $D$ theorem states:\n$$DP \\cdot DA = DB^2$$\n\nWe need to"]]
