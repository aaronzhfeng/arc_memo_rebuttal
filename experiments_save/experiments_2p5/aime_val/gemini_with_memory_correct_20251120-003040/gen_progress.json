For a quadrilateral formed by four vertices of a regular $N$-gon to be a rectangle, the vertices must be diametrically opposite in pairs. This is only possible if $N$ is even.

A line segment connecting two vertices $V_i$ and $V_j$ is a diameter if and only if the number of vertices between $V_i$ and $V_j$ along one arc is equal to the number of vertices along the other arc. Since there are 12 vertices in total, this means the vertices must be separated by $12/2 = 6$ positions.\nIf the vertices are indexed $1, 2, \\ldots, 12$, a pair $(V_i, V_j)$ forms a diameter if $j = i + 6 \\pmod{12}$ (where indices are taken in $\\{1, \\ldots, 12\\}$).\n\nThe pairs of opposite vertices that form diameters are:\n$(V_1, V_7), (V_2, V_8), (V_3, V_9), (V_4, V_{10}), (V_5, V_{11}), (V_6, V_{12})$.\nThere are $12/2 = 6$ such diameters.\n\nA rectangle is formed by choosing two distinct diameters.

The sides of the rectangle are the segments connecting the chosen vertices, e.g., $V_i V_j$, $V_j V_{i+6}$, $V_{i+6} V_{j+6}$, and $V_{j+6} V_i$. These segments are diagonals of the dodecagon (or sides, if the vertices are adjacent, which is impossible for a rectangle formed by diameters).\n\nLet's verify the nature of the sides formed by these rectangles.\nConsider the rectangle formed by diameters $D_1 = (V_1, V_7)$ and $D_2 = (V_2, V_8)$.
