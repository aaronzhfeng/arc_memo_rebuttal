Use the constraint that the variables $A, B, C$ must be positive (or within a specific geometric range) to select the unique set of sums that satisfies the triangle inequality condition on the sums: $S_{AB} + S_{BC} > S_{CA}$ (when considering $A+B+C$). \n- situation: A geometry problem where multiple segments are proven equal, leading to a chain of isosceles triangles.\n  suggestion: Assign a single unknown angle (e.g., $\\beta$) to a key vertex angle and express all other angles in the figure solely in terms of $\\beta$ using the properties of isosceles triangles and the sum of angles in a triangle.","2025_II_10":"- situation: When counting arrangements (permutations) subject to multiple forbidden adjacent pairs (e.g., A cannot be next to B, B cannot be next to C).\n  suggestion: Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (PIE). Define the properties $P_i$ as the condition that the $i$-th forbidden adjacency occurs. Systematically calculate $S_k$, the sum of the counts of arrangements satisfying exactly $k$ properties, by grouping the constrained elements into rigid blocks and permuting these blocks.\n- situation: When counting the number of sequences $(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_k)$ such that $0 \\le x_1 \\le x_2 \\le \\dots \\le x_k \\le n$ (non-decreasing sequences with replacement).\n  suggestion: Apply the stars and bars technique for combinations with repetition: the count is $\\binom{n+k}{k}$ or equivalently $\\binom{n+k}{n}$.\n- situation: When the counting process results in a nested summation structure where the limits of the inner sum depend linearly on the index of the outer sum, leading to a sum of triangular numbers.\n  suggestion: If the total count $N$ is $\\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\frac{j(j+1)}{2}$, use the identity for the sum of triangular numbers: $N = \\binom{L+2}{3}$. If the sum starts at $L=0$, the identity still holds for $L_{max}$ as $\\binom{L_{max}+2}{3}$.\n- situation: When calculating the total number of distinct arrangements of $2n$ items consisting of $n$ pairs of identical items.\n  suggestion: Use the multinomial coefficient formula for permutations with repetition: $\\frac{(2n)!}{2^n}$.\n- situation: When the total number of outcomes is $|S|^k$ and the favorable outcomes are $N_{\\text{fav}} = N_1 N_2 \\cdots$, leading to a probability ratio involving factorials and powers.\n  suggestion: Instead of calculating the large numerator and denominator separately, express the terms using their factored forms (e.g., $\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n(n-1)\\cdots}{k!}$) and simplify the resulting fraction algebraically by canceling common factors before final multiplication.","2025_II_11":"- situation: When calculating the total number of distinct arrangements of $2n$ items consisting of $n$ pairs of identical items.\n  suggestion: Use the multinomial coefficient formula for permutations with repetition: $\\frac{(2n)!}{2^n}$.\n- situation: When solving a linear Diophantine equation $Ax + By + Cz = D$ where the variables $x, y, z$ are constrained to small, finite, non-negative integer ranges (e.g., single digits in a specific base).\n  suggestion: Isolate the term with the largest coefficient (or the term whose coefficient is most constrained by the range) and iterate through its possible values, substituting back to solve the resulting two-variable linear equation.\n- situation: When the derived necessary and sufficient condition for a pair $(m, n)$ depends on the powers of a specific prime dividing $m$ and $n$ (e.g., $v_2(m) = v_2(n)$) and the residue of the remaining factors modulo that prime's exponent plus one (e.g., $m' \\equiv n' \\pmod 4$).\n  suggestion: Partition the set of possible integers $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$ into disjoint subsets based on the common exponent $e$ and the residue $r$ of the odd part. For each subset $S_{e, r}$, count the number of elements $|S_{e, r}|$. The total number of valid pairs $(m, n)$ with $m < n$ is the sum of $\\binom{|S_{e, r}|}{2}$ over all relevant $(e, r)$ combinations.\n- situation: When a divisibility chain $a_1 | a_2 | \\dots | a_k$ is imposed on divisors of a number $N = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots$, and the exponents of the primes are independent variables.\n  suggestion: Decompose the problem by prime factor. For each prime $p_i$, count the number of non-decreasing sequences of exponents $(x_{i,1}, x_{i,2}, \\dots, x_{i,k})$ such that $0 \\le x_{i,j} \\le e_i$. The total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these counts.\n- situation: When an integer $N$ is factored into a product of powers of distinct primes, $N = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots$, and we seek the number of ways to write $N$ as a product $m \\cdot n$ where $m$ and $n$ have specific forms involving those same primes.\n  suggestion: Express $m$ and $n$ using the same prime basis, $m = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots$ and $n = p_1^{c_1} p_2^{c_2} \\cdots$, and equate the exponents to form a system of independent linear equations for each prime base."}
