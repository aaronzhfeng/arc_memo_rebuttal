[["Let $a=BC=9$, $b=AC=10$, and $c=AB=5$. Let $R$ be the radius of the circumcircle $\\omega$ of $\\triangle ABC$.\nThe area $K$ of $\\triangle ABC$ can be found using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter $s$ is $s = \\frac{a+b+c}{2} = \\frac{9+10+5}{2} = \\frac{24}{2} = 12$.\nThe area $K$ is given by $K = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \\sqrt{12(12-9)(12-10)(12-5)} = \\sqrt{12 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7} = \\sqrt{36 \\cdot 14} = 6\\sqrt{14}$.\n\nThe circumradius $R$ is given by $R = \\frac{abc}{4K}$.\n$R = \\frac{5 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 10}{4 \\cdot 6\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{450}{24\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{75}{4\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{75\\sqrt{14}}{56}$.\n\nLet $O$ be the center of $\\omega$. $D$ is the intersection of the tangents to $\\omega$ at $B$ and $C$. Thus, $DB=DC$, and $OD$ is the perpendicular bisector of $BC$. Also, $OB \\perp BD$ and $OC \\perp CD$.\nSince $DB$ and $DC$ are tangents, $\\triangle DBC$ is an isosceles triangle with $DB=DC$. $D$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$.\n\nWe are interested in the length $AP$. $P$ is the intersection of $AD$ and $\\omega$.\nWe can use the power of a point theorem, but $D$ is outside the circle. We need a relationship involving $AD$ and $AP$.\n\nLet's use coordinates or properties related to the radical axis/power of a point.\nSince $D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$, $D$ lies on the polar line of $D$ with respect to $\\omega$, which is the line $BC$. Wait, no, $BC$ is the chord of contact. The line $BC$ is the polar of $D$.\n\nLet $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. $DM \\perp BC$. $OM \\perp BC$. Thus $O, M, D$ are collinear.\nIn $\\triangle OBC$, $OB=OC=R$. $BM = MC = a/2 = 9/2$.\nIn right triangle $\\triangle OMB$, $OM^2 = R^2 - (9/2)^2 = R^2 - 81/4$.\n$R^2 = \\left(\\frac{75}{4\\sqrt{14}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{5625}{16 \\cdot 14} = \\frac{5625}{224}$.\n$OM^2 = \\frac{5625}{224} - \\frac{81}{4} = \\frac{5625 - 81 \\cdot 56}{224} = \\frac{5625 - 4536}{224} = \\frac{1089}{224}$.\n$OM = \\sqrt{\\frac{1089}{224}} = \\frac{33}{\\sqrt{224}} = \\frac{33}{4\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{33\\sqrt{14}}{56}$.\n\nIn right triangle $\\triangle OBD$, $OB \\perp BD$. $OB=R$.\n$D$ is on the line $OM$. Let $d = OD$. In $\\triangle ODB$, $DB^2 = d^2 - R^2$.\nAlso, in $\\triangle DMB$, $DB^2 = DM^2 + BM^2 = DM^2 + (9/2)^2$.\nSince $O, M, D$ are collinear, $DM = |d - OM|$.\n\nA key property involving the intersection of tangents $D$ and the circumcircle is related to the Simson line or properties of the polar.\nThe line $AD$ intersects $\\omega$ at $A$ and $P$. $D$ is outside $\\omega$.\nThe power of point $D$ with respect to $\\omega$ is $DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\nWe need to find $DA$ and $DB$.\n\nWe can use Stewart's theorem or Apollonius theorem on $\\triangle ABC$ if we knew the length of the cevian $AD$. But $D$ is not on $BC$.\n\nLet's find $DB$. In right $\\triangle ODB$, $DB^2 = OD^2 - R^2$.\nWe need $OD$. $OD$ is related to $R$ and $OM$.\nIn $\\triangle ODB$, $\\cos(\\angle DOB) = R/OD$.\nIn $\\triangle OCB$, let $\\theta = \\angle BOC$. $a^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2R^2 \\cos\\theta$, so $81 = 2R^2(1-\\cos\\theta)$.\nAlso, $\\angle BOD = \\theta/2$.\n$OM = R \\cos(\\theta/2)$. $DM = R \\tan(\\theta/2)$. No, this is not correct. $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. $\\angle BOM = \\theta/2$.\n$OM = R \\cos(\\theta/2)$. $BM = R \\sin(\\theta/2)$. $9/2 = R \\sin(\\theta/2)$.\n\nIn $\\triangle ODB$, $\\angle OBD = 90^\\circ$. $OD$ is the hypotenuse.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents. $OD$ bisects $\\angle BOC$. So $\\angle BOD = \\theta/2$.\nIn $\\triangle ODB$, $DB = R \\tan(\\theta/2)$.\nWe have $R \\sin(\\theta/2) = 9/2$.\n$\\tan(\\theta/2) = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta/2)}{\\cos(\\theta/2)} = \\frac{9/2R}{\\sqrt{1 - (9/2R)^2}} = \\frac{9/2R}{\\sqrt{\\frac{4R^2-81}{4R^2}}} = \\frac{9/2R}{\\frac{\\sqrt{4R^2-81}}{2R}} = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{4R^2-81}}$.\n$4R^2 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{5625}{224} = \\frac{5625}{56}$.\n$4R^2 - 81 = \\frac{5625}{56} - 81 = \\frac{5625 - 81 \\cdot 56}{56} = \\frac{5625 - 4536}{56} = \\frac{1089}{56}$.\n$\\sqrt{4R^2-81} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1089}{56}} = \\frac{33}{\\sqrt{56}} = \\frac{33}{2\\sqrt{14}}$.\n\n$DB = R \\tan(\\theta/2) = R \\cdot \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{4R^2-81}}$.\n$DB = \\frac{75}{4\\sqrt{14}} \\cdot \\frac{9}{33/(2\\sqrt{14})} = \\frac{75}{4\\sqrt{14}} \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\frac{2\\sqrt{14}}{33} = \\frac{75 \\cdot 18}{4 \\cdot 33} = \\frac{75 \\cdot 9}{2 \\cdot 33} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 9}{2 \\cdot 11} = \\frac{225}{22}$.\nSo $DB^2 = \\left(\\frac{225}{22}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50625}{484}$.\n\nThe power of $D$ is $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\nWe need $DA$. $D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$. $A, B, C$ are on $\\omega$.\nThe line $AD$ is a line passing through $A$. $P$ is the other intersection point.\nWe can use the property that $D$ is the center of a circle passing through $B$ and $C$ that is orthogonal to $\\omega$. No, that's not helpful.\n\nWe use the property that $D$ is the pole of $BC$.\nLet's use coordinates, placing $O$ at the origin $(0,0)$. This might be complicated due to $R$ being irrational in terms of simple numbers.\n\nLet's use lengths and angles.\nLet $\\angle DAB = \\alpha$ and $\\angle DAC = \\beta$. $\\angle BAC = A$. $A = \\alpha + \\beta$ or $A = |\\alpha - \\beta|$.\nSince $D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$, $D$ lies on the angle bisector of $\\angle BOC$.\nAlso, $AD$ is a line.\n\nA known result states that for a point $D$ outside the circle, if $DA$ intersects the circle at $P$, then $DA \\cdot DP = DB^2$.\nWe need $DA$.\n\nLet's use the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle ACD$.\nLet $d_A = DA$. Let $\\angle DAB = \\alpha$ and $\\angle DAC = \\gamma$.\nIn $\\triangle ABC$, we can find $\\cos A$ using the Law of Cosines:\n$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos A$.\n$9^2 = 10^2 + 5^2 - 2(10)(5) \\cos A$.\n$81 = 100 + 25 - 100 \\cos A$.\n$81 = 125 - 100 \\cos A$.\n$100 \\cos A = 125 - 81 = 44$.\n$\\cos A = 44/100 = 11/25$.\n\nLet $\\angle ADB = \\delta_1$ and $\\angle ADC = \\delta_2$.\nSince $DB=DC$, $\\triangle DBC$ is isosceles. $AD$ is a line segment.\nLet $\\angle ADC = \\angle ADB = \\delta$. This is true if $AD$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle BDC$.\nSince $DB=DC$, $D$ lies on the perpendicular bisector of $BC$. Let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. $DM \\perp BC$.\nLet $AD$ intersect $BC$ at $E$. $AE$ is a cevian.\nIf $AD$ were the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$, then $D$ would be on the angle bisector of $A$.\n\nLet's use the property that $D$ is the pole of $BC$. The line $AD$ is not special in general with respect to $A$.\n\nWe use the property that $D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$.\nThe line $AD$ intersects $\\omega$ at $A$ and $P$.\nA known result (related to the Simson line or properties of the polar) states that the line $AD$ is the symmedian from $A$ of $\\triangle ABC$ if $D$ were the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$ of the circumcircle of $\\triangle ABC$. Wait, this is not correct. The symmedian from $A$ passes through the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$ if $A, B, C$ are points on a circle.\nLet $K$ be the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$. The symmedian from $A$ passes through $D$ if $D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$.\nLet $t_A$ be the tangent at $A$. Let $t_B, t_C$ be tangents at $B, C$. $D = t_B \\cap t_C$.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian from $A$ of $\\triangle ABC$.\n\nLet $s_a$ be the symmedian from $A$. $s_a$ divides $BC$ in ratio $c^2:b^2$.\nLet $E$ be the intersection of $AD$ and $BC$. Then $BE/EC = c^2/b^2 = 5^2/10^2 = 25/100 = 1/4$.\nSince $BC=9$, $BE = 9/(1+4) = 9/5$, and $EC = 4 \\cdot 9/5 = 36/5$.\n\nWe need $DA$. We can use Stewart's theorem on $\\triangle ABC$ with cevian $AE$.\n$c^2 \\cdot EC + b^2 \\cdot BE = a (AE^2 + BE \\cdot EC)$.\n$5^2 \\cdot (36/5) + 10^2 \\cdot (9/5) = 9 (AE^2 + (9/5)(36/5))$.\n$25 \\cdot (36/5) + 100 \\cdot (9/5) = 9 (AE^2 + 324/25)$.\n$5 \\cdot 36 + 20 \\cdot 9 = 9 AE^2 + 9 \\cdot 324/25$.\n$180 + 180 = 9 AE^2 + 2916/25$.\n$360 = 9 AE^2 + 2916/25$.\nDivide by 9:\n$40 = AE^2 + 324/25$.\n$AE^2 = 40 - 324/25 = \\frac{1000 - 324}{25} = \\frac{676}{25}$.\n$AE = \\sqrt{676/25} = 26/5$.\n\nNow we need $DA$. $D, E, A$ are collinear. $E$ is between $A$ and $D$ or $A$ is between $D$ and $E$ or $D$ is between $A$ and $E$.\nSince $D$ is outside the circle, and $A$ is on the circle, $AD$ is a secant line. $P$ is on the circle.\nIf $E$ is between $A$ and $D$, then $AD = AE + ED$. If $A$ is between $E$ and $D$, then $AD = ED - AE$. If $D$ is between $A$ and $E$, this is impossible since $D$ is outside the circle and $A$ is on the circle.\n\nWe need to determine the relative positions of $A, E, D$.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$. $AD$ is the symmedian.\nThe symmedian $s_a$ is the reflection of the median $m_a$ across the angle bisector of $A$.\nThe angle bisector of $A$ intersects $BC$ at a point $F$ such that $BF/FC = c/b = 5/10 = 1/2$. $BF = 9/3 = 3$, $FC = 6$.\nSince $BE = 9/5 = 1.8$ and $BF = 3$, $E$ is between $B$ and $F$. $B, E, F, C$ are in order on $BC$.\nThe symmedian $AD$ is \"closer\" to $AB$ than the median $AM$.\n\nLet's find $DM$. $DM$ is the altitude of $\\triangle DBC$.\nWe can use the property that $D$ is the pole of $BC$.\nLet $R$ be the circumradius. Let $d_O = OD$.\nThe distance from $O$ to $BC$ is $OM$. $OM = \\frac{33\\sqrt{14}}{56}$.\n$OD$ is related to $R$ and $OM$ by $R^2 = OM \\cdot OD$ if $BC$ were a tangent, which is not the case.\nThe relationship for the pole $D$ of chord $BC$ is $OM \\cdot OD = R^2$.\n$OD = R^2 / OM$.\n$OD = \\frac{5625/224}{33\\sqrt{14}/56} = \\frac{5625}{224} \\cdot \\frac{56}{33\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{5625}{4 \\cdot 33\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{1875}{4 \\cdot 11\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{1875}{44\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{1875\\sqrt{14}}{44 \\cdot 14} = \\frac{1875\\sqrt{14}}{616}$.\n\nWe can check $DB^2 = OD^2 - R^2$.\n$OD^2 = \\frac{1875^2}{44^2 \\cdot 14} = \\frac{3515625}{1936 \\cdot 14} = \\frac{3515625}{27104}$.\n$R^2 = \\frac{5625}{224} = \\frac{5625 \\cdot 121}{224 \\cdot 121} = \\frac{680625}{27104}$. Wait, $27104/224 = 121$.\n$DB^2 = \\frac{3515625 - 680625}{27104} = \\frac{2835000}{27104}$.\nLet's check $DB^2 = (225/22)^2 = 50625/484$.\n$27104 / 484 = 56$.\n$50625 \\cdot 56 = 2835000$. This confirms $DB^2 = 50625/484$.\n\nNow we need $DA$. We use the coordinates approach for $DA$ or vector approach, but maybe there is a simpler geometric way using the symmedian property.\n\nLet $K$ be the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$. The line $AD$ is the symmedian $s_a$.\nThe symmedian $s_a$ divides the angle $A$ into $\\angle BAs_a = \\angle CAM$ and $\\angle CAs_a = \\angle BAM$, where $AM$ is the median.\nLet $\\angle BAM = \\theta_c$ and $\\angle CAM = \\theta_b$.\nIn $\\triangle ABM$, $BM=9/2$, $c=5$, $m_a=AE$. Wait, $AE$ is not the median $m_a$. $E$ is the intersection of $AD$ and $BC$. $AE$ is the length of the segment of the symmedian from $A$ to $BC$.\nLet $m_a$ be the length of the median $AM$.\n$4m_a^2 = 2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2 = 2(100) + 2(25) - 81 = 200 + 50 - 81 = 169$.\n$m_a = 13/2$.\n\nThe length of the symmedian $s_a = AE = 26/5$.\nWe need $DA$. $D$ is the pole of $BC$. $A$ is on the circle. $E$ is on $BC$.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian.\n\nLet's use the property that $D$ is the pole of $BC$.\nThe line $AD$ intersects the circle at $A$ and $P$.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian.\n\nLet $t_A$ be the tangent at $A$. Let $t_A$ intersect $BC$ at $K$.\nThe line $AK$ is the symmedian $AD$. So $K=E$.\nThus $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$.\nThis means $AE$ is the segment of the tangent from $A$ to $BC$.\n\nLet's verify this property: The line connecting $A$ to the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$ is the symmedian from $A$.\nLet $t_A$ be the tangent at $A$. Let $K = t_A \\cap BC$.\nThe line $AK$ is the symmedian from $A$.\nIf $D = t_B \\cap t_C$, then $AD$ is the symmedian. So $D$ lies on the line $AK$.\nSince $D$ is defined by $t_B$ and $t_C$, and $A, B, C$ are on $\\omega$, the line $AD$ is indeed the symmedian from $A$.\nThe intersection of the symmedian $AD$ with $BC$ is $E$.\nThe intersection of the tangent at $A$ with $BC$ is $K$.\nThe property states that $K$ lies on $AD$. So $K=E$.\nThus $AE$ is the segment of the tangent from $A$ to $BC$.\n\nIf $AE$ is the tangent segment from $A$ to $BC$, then by the tangent-secant theorem applied to $A$ and line $BC$ (if $BC$ were a line segment outside the circle, which it is not), we have $AB^2 = AK \\cdot AC$ if $K$ is on the extension of $BC$. No, this is not correct.\n\nIf $AE$ is the tangent segment from $A$ to $BC$, this means $AE$ is the length of the tangent from $A$ to some circle, which is not the case here. $E$ is on $BC$.\n\nLet's use the property of the tangent $t_A$ intersecting $BC$ at $K$.\n$KB/KC = c^2/b^2 = 1/4$. This is the same ratio as $BE/EC$. So $K=E$.\nThe tangent at $A$ intersects $BC$ at $E$.\nBy the tangent-secant theorem applied to $A$ and the circle $\\omega$ using the line $BC$ is not applicable.\nHowever, for the tangent $AE$ to $BC$ at $E$, we have the property that $AE^2 = AB \\cdot AC \\cos^2(A/2)$? No.\n\nIf $AE$ is the tangent from $A$ to $BC$, then $AE^2 = AB \\cdot AC - BE \\cdot EC$ if $E$ is between $B$ and $C$. This is related to the length of the tangent from $A$ to the circle passing through $B, C$ and the intersection of $AB, AC$.\n\nLet $t_A$ be the tangent at $A$. $E$ is the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$.\nFor any point $X$ on $BC$, the power of $X$ with respect to $\\omega$ is $XB \\cdot XC$ if $X$ is outside, or $-XB \\cdot XC$ if $X$ is inside.\nThe power of $E$ with respect to $\\omega$ is $EA^2$ if $EA$ is tangent to $\\omega$ at $A$.\nSince $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and the line $BC$, the power of $E$ with respect to $\\omega$ is $EA^2$.\nThe power of $E$ with respect to $\\omega$ is also $EB \\cdot EC$ if $E$ is outside $BC$, or $-EB \\cdot EC$ if $E$ is between $B$ and $C$.\nSince $BE = 9/5 = 1.8$ and $BC=9$, $E$ is between $B$ and $C$.\nSo, the power of $E$ is $-EB \\cdot EC$.\n$EA^2 = -EB \\cdot EC$. This is impossible since $EA^2 > 0$.\n\nThe power of a point $E$ outside the circle is $d^2 - R^2$. If $E$ is on the tangent line at $A$, the power is $EA^2$.\nIf $E$ is on the line $BC$, the power is $EB \\cdot EC$ if $E$ is outside the segment $BC$.\nSince $E$ is between $B$ and $C$, $E$ is inside the circle $\\omega$. The power of $E$ must be negative.\n$E$ is inside $\\omega$ if $AE$ is a chord. $A$ is on $\\omega$. $E$ is on $BC$. $BC$ is a chord.\nIf $E$ is inside $\\omega$, the power of $E$ is $-EB \\cdot EC$.\nIf $E$ is on the tangent at $A$, the power of $E$ is $EA^2$. This implies $EA^2 = -EB \\cdot EC$, which is impossible.\n\nTherefore, $E$ must be outside the circle $\\omega$.\nIf $E$ is outside $\\omega$, then $E$ must be on the extension of $BC$.\n$BE/EC = 1/4$. $BC=9$. If $E$ is on the side of $B$, $EB+BC=EC$. $EB+9=4EB \\implies 3EB=9 \\implies EB=3$. Then $EC=12$. $BE/EC = 3/12 = 1/4$. This is possible.\nIf $E$ is on the side of $C$, $BC+CE=BE$. $9+CE=4CE \\implies 3CE=9 \\implies CE=3$. Then $BE=12$. $BE/EC = 12/3 = 4$. This is not $1/4$.\nSo $E$ is on the extension of $BC$ beyond $B$. $E-B-C$. $EB=3, EC=12$.\n\nIf $E$ is outside $\\omega$, the power of $E$ is $EA^2$.\nThe power of $E$ is also $EB \\cdot EC = 3 \\cdot 12 = 36$.\nSo $EA^2 = 36$, which means $AE = 6$.\n\nLet's check this against the previous calculation of $AE$ using Stewart's theorem, which assumed $E$ was between $B$ and $C$.\nIf $E$ is between $B$ and $C$, $BE=9/5, EC=36/5$. $AE^2 = 676/25$, $AE=26/5 = 5.2$.\nIf $E$ is outside $BC$, $AE=6$.\n\nThe symmedian $AD$ intersects $BC$ at $E$. The symmedian divides the angle $A$ into $\\angle BAE$ and $\\angle CAE$.\nThe symmedian divides the opposite side $BC$ in the ratio $c^2:b^2$. This property holds regardless of whether $E$ is internal or external to $BC$.\nIf $E$ is internal, $BE/EC = c^2/b^2$. This is what we used first, leading to $AE=26/5$.\nIf $E$ is external, $BE/EC = -c^2/b^2$ in directed segments, or $BE/EC = c^2/b^2$ in lengths if $E$ is on the extension of $BC$.\n\nThe symmedian $s_a$ is defined as the isogonal conjugate of the median $m_a$.\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, then $\\angle BAE = \\angle CAM$ and $\\angle CAE = \\angle BAM$, where $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$.\nSince $M$ is the midpoint, $BM=MC=4.5$. $BE=1.8, EC=7.2$. $E$ is between $B$ and $C$.\nSo $AE = 26/5$ is correct for the length of the segment of the symmedian from $A$ to $BC$.\n\nNow, we must reconcile this with the property that $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$.\nIf $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$, then $E$ must be outside $\\omega$ for $EA^2$ to be the power of $E$.\nIf $E$ is outside $\\omega$, then $E$ must be on the extension of $BC$. This contradicts $E$ being between $B$ and $C$ based on the symmedian property for internal division.\n\nLet's re-examine the symmedian property. The symmedian $s_a$ is the isogonal conjugate of the median $m_a$.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian. $E = AD \\cap BC$.\nIf $E$ is between $B$ and $C$, then $BE/EC = c^2/b^2 = 1/4$. This implies $E$ is internal.\nIf $E$ is internal, $AE = 26/5$.\n\nIf $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$, then $E$ must be external to $BC$ for $EA^2$ to be the power of $E$.\nIf $E$ is external, $BE/EC = c^2/b^2$ in lengths, $EB=3, EC=12$. This implies $AE=6$.\n\nThe property that $AD$ is the symmedian is correct.\nThe property that the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$ lies on the symmedian $AD$ is correct. Let this intersection be $K$. So $K$ lies on $AD$.\nIf $K$ is the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$, then $K$ must be external to $BC$ for $KA^2$ to be the power of $K$.\nIf $K$ is external, $KB/KC = c^2/b^2$ in lengths, so $KB=3, KC=12$. $AE=6$.\n\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, $E = AD \\cap BC$. $E$ must divide $BC$ internally in ratio $c^2/b^2$. $BE=9/5, EC=36/5$. $AE=26/5$.\n\nThere is a contradiction unless $E=K$. If $E=K$, then $E$ must be both internal (from symmedian property) and external (from tangent property). This is impossible.\n\nLet's re-read the theorem about the symmedian and the tangent.\nTheorem: The symmedian from $A$ passes through the intersection of the tangents at $B$ and $C$ (point $D$).\nTheorem: The symmedian from $A$ passes through the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and the line $BC$ (point $K$).\nSo $D, A, K$ are collinear. Wait, $A$ is on the line $AD$. So $D, A, E$ are collinear.\nIf $K$ is the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$, then $K$ lies on $AD$. So $K$ must be $E$.\nSo $E$ must be the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$.\n\nIf $E$ is the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$, then $E$ must be outside $\\omega$.\nIf $E$ is outside $\\omega$, then $E$ must be external to $BC$.\nIf $E$ is external, $BE/EC = c^2/b^2$ in lengths, $EB=3, EC=12$. $AE=6$.\n\nIf $E$ is external, the symmedian $AD$ intersects $BC$ externally.\nThe symmedian divides the angle $A$ into $\\angle BAE$ and $\\angle CAE$.\nIf $E$ is external, the ratio of division is $BE/EC = c^2/b^2$ in lengths. This is correct.\nThe property that the symmedian divides the opposite side in ratio $c^2:b^2$ holds for external division as well.\nIf $E$ is external, $AE$ is the length of the segment of the symmedian from $A$ to the line $BC$.\n\nSo we must use $AE=6$.\nLet's check the calculation for $AE$ using Stewart's theorem for external division.\n$E$ is on the extension of $BC$ beyond $B$. $E-B-C$. $EB=3, BC=9, EC=12$.\nStewart's theorem: $c^2 \\cdot EC - b^2 \\cdot EB = a (AE^2 - EB \\cdot EC)$. (The sign changes because $E$ is external).\n$5^2 \\cdot 12 - 10^2 \\cdot 3 = 9 (AE^2 - 3 \\cdot 12)$.\n$25 \\cdot 12 - 100 \\cdot 3 = 9 (AE^2 - 36)$.\n$300 - 300 = 9 (AE^2 - 36)$.\n$0 = 9 (AE^2 - 36)$.\n$AE^2 = 36$, so $AE=6$. This confirms $AE=6$.\n\nSince $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$, the power of $E$ with respect to $\\omega$ is $EA^2 = 36$.\nSince $E$ is on the line $AD$, and $A, P$ are on $\\omega$, the power of $E$ is $EA \\cdot EP'$ where $P'$ is the other intersection of $AD$ with $\\omega$. Wait, $P$ is the other intersection.\nThe power of $E$ is $EA \\cdot EP$ if $E$ is outside.\nIf $E$ is outside $\\omega$, $E$ is on the line $AD$. $A$ is on $\\omega$. $P$ is on $\\omega$.\nSince $E$ is outside, $A$ must be between $E$ and $P$, or $P$ must be between $E$ and $A$.\nSince $E$ is outside, $EA$ and $EP$ are measured from $E$.\nIf $A$ is between $E$ and $P$, $EP = EA + AP$. Power is $EA \\cdot EP$.\nIf $P$ is between $E$ and $A$, $EA = EP + PA$. Power is $EP \\cdot EA$.\n\nSince $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$, $E$ is outside $\\omega$.\nThe line $AD$ passes through $E$. $A$ and $P$ are on $\\omega$.\nThe power of $E$ is $EA \\cdot EP$ if $E$ is outside.\nWe need to know the order of $E, A, P$.\nSince $E$ is outside $\\omega$, the line $EA$ intersects $\\omega$ at two points. One is $A$. The other is $P$.\nThe power of $E$ is $EA \\cdot EP$.\nIf $A$ is between $E$ and $P$, then $EP = EA + AP$. Power is $EA(EA+AP)$.\nIf $P$ is between $E$ and $A$, then $EA = EP + PA$. Power is $EP(EP+PA)$.\n\nLet's use the property $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$. This involves $D$, not $E$.\n\nWe have $AE=6$. $D$ lies on the line $AE$.\nWe need $DA$. $D$ is the pole of $BC$. $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$. $D, A, E$ are collinear.\n\nWe need the position of $D$ relative to $A$ and $E$.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$. $OD \\perp BC$. $OM \\perp BC$. $O, M, D$ are collinear.\n$E$ is on $BC$. $AE$ is the tangent at $A$. $OA \\perp AE$.\n$O, A, E$ form a right triangle $\\triangle OAE$ with hypotenuse $OE$. $OA=R$. $AE=6$.\n$OE^2 = R^2 + AE^2 = R^2 + 36$.\n$R^2 = 5625/224$.\n$OE^2 = \\frac{5625}{224} + 36 = \\frac{5625 + 36 \\cdot 224}{224} = \\frac{5625 + 8064}{224} = \\frac{13689}{224}$.\n$13689 = 117^2$.\n$OE = \\frac{117}{\\sqrt{224}} = \\frac{117}{4\\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{117\\sqrt{14}}{56}$.\n\n$O, M, D$ are collinear. $M$ is the midpoint of $BC$. $E$ is on $BC$. $E$ is not $M$.\n$M$ is the projection of $O$ onto $BC$. $E$ is on $BC$. $ME = |EB - MB| = |3 - 4.5| = 1.5 = 3/2$.\nIn $\\triangle OME$, $OE^2 = OM^2 + ME^2$.\n$OM^2 = 1089/224$. $ME^2 = (3/2)^2 = 9/4 = 9 \\cdot 56 / 224 = 504/224$.\n$OM^2 + ME^2 = \\frac{1089 + 504}{224} = \\frac{1593}{224}$.\nWait, $OE^2$ calculated from $R$ and $AE$ was $13689/224$.\n$1593 \\neq 13689$. There is an error in assuming $E$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$.\n\nLet's re-examine the property: The line $AD$ (where $D=t_B \\cap t_C$) is the symmedian from $A$.\nThe symmedian from $A$ intersects $BC$ at $E$ such that $BE/EC = c^2/b^2$.\nIf $E$ is internal, $AE=26/5$.\nIf $E$ is external, $AE=6$.\n\nThe property that $AD$ passes through $K = t_A \\cap BC$ is correct. So $E=K$.\nIf $E=K$, then $E$ must be external to $BC$, so $AE=6$.\n\nLet's check why $AE=26/5$ resulted from Stewart's theorem for internal division.\nIf $E$ is internal, $BE=9/5, EC=36/5$. $AE=26/5$.\nIf $E$ is external, $EB=3, EC=12$. $AE=6$.\n\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, it must divide $BC$ internally in ratio $c^2/b^2$ if $A$ is acute/obtuse, unless the definition of symmedian implies external division in some cases.\nThe symmedian is the isogonal conjugate of the median. The median always divides the side internally. The isogonal conjugate must also divide the side internally, unless the angle $A$ is $180^\\circ$.\nIf $E$ is internal, $AE=26/5$.\n\nIf $E$ is internal, $E$ is inside $\\omega$. The power of $E$ is $-EB \\cdot EC = -(9/5)(36/5) = -324/25$.\nIf $E$ is on the tangent $t_A$, the power of $E$ is $EA^2$. This is a contradiction.\nSo $E$ cannot be internal. $E$ must be external. $AE=6$.\n\nIf $E$ is external, $E$ is outside $\\omega$. The power of $E$ is $EA^2 = 36$.\nIf $E$ is external, $E$ must divide $BC$ externally in ratio $c^2/b^2$. $EB=3, EC=12$. This is consistent with $AE=6$.\nSo $E$ is external, $AE=6$.\n\nNow we use the fact that $D, A, E$ are collinear. $D$ is outside $\\omega$. $A$ is on $\\omega$. $E$ is outside $\\omega$.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$. $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\n\nWe need $DA$. We know $AE=6$. We need the relative positions of $D, A, E$.\n$D$ is the pole of $BC$. $E$ is on $BC$. $AE$ is tangent to $\\omega$ at $A$. $OA \\perp AE$.\n$O, A, E$ form a right triangle. $OE^2 = R^2 + AE^2 = R^2 + 36$. This was calculated as $13689/224$.\n\n$D$ lies on the line $AE$. $D$ is outside $\\omega$. $A$ is on $\\omega$. $P$ is on $\\omega$.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents. $D$ is further from $O$ than $R$. $OD > R$.\n$OD^2 = R^2 + DB^2 = R^2 + 50625/484$.\n$R^2 = 5625/224$.\n$OD^2 = \\frac{5625}{224} + \\frac{50625}{484}$.\n$224 = 16 \\cdot 14$. $484 = 4 \\cdot 121$. LCM is $16 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 121 / \\gcd(14, 121) = 16 \\cdot 14 \\cdot 121 = 27104$.\n$27104/224 = 121$. $27104/484 = 56$.\n$OD^2 = \\frac{5625 \\cdot 121 + 50625 \\cdot 56}{27104} = \\frac{680625 + 2835000}{27104} = \\frac{3515625}{27104}$.\n$OD = \\sqrt{\\frac{3515625}{27104}}$.\n\nWe need $DA$. $D, A, E$ are collinear. $OA \\perp AE$.\nIn $\\triangle OAD$, we have $OA=R$, $OD$, and $\\angle OAD$.\nSince $AE$ is tangent at $A$, $\\angle OAE = 90^\\circ$.\nSince $D$ lies on the line $AE$, $\\angle OAD$ is either $90^\\circ$ or $270^\\circ$ (if $D$ is on the other side of $A$ from $E$).\nSince $D$ is outside $\\omega$, $D$ must be on the ray $AE$ or $EA$ extended.\n\nIf $D$ is on the ray $AE$, then $AD = DE - AE$ or $AD = DE + AE$.\nIf $D$ is on the ray $EA$, then $DA = DE + EA$ or $DA = |DE - EA|$.\n\nLet's determine the order of $D, A, E$.\n$E$ is outside $\\omega$. $D$ is outside $\\omega$. $A$ is on $\\omega$.\nSince $AE$ is tangent at $A$, $A$ is the point on $\\omega$ closest to $E$ along the line $AE$.\nIf $D$ is on the ray $AE$, then $DA$ is the distance from $D$ to $A$.\nIf $D$ is on the ray $EA$ beyond $A$, then $DA = DE - AE$.\nIf $D$ is on the ray $AE$ beyond $A$, then $DA = AE - DE$. (Impossible since $D$ is further from $O$ than $A$).\n\nLet's use coordinates for $O, A, E$. Let $O=(0,0)$. $R$ is the radius.\nLet $A = (R, 0)$. Then $AE$ is vertical. $E = (R, 6)$ or $E = (R, -6)$. Let $E=(R, 6)$.\n$OE^2 = R^2 + 6^2$. This matches.\n$D$ lies on the line $AE$, so $D = (R, y_D)$.\n$OD^2 = R^2 + y_D^2$.\n$y_D$ is the signed distance $AD$ if $A$ is the origin on the line $AE$. No, $y_D$ is the coordinate.\n$AE = |y_E - y_A| = |6 - 0| = 6$.\n$AD = |y_D - y_A| = |y_D|$.\n$DE = |y_D - y_E| = |y_D - 6|$.\n\nIf $D$ is further from $O$ than $E$, then $OD > OE$.\n$OD^2 = 3515625/27104 \\approx 129.705$.\n$OE^2 = 13689/224 \\approx 61.1116$.\nSince $OD > OE$, $D$ is further from $O$ than $E$.\nSince $A$ is between $O$ and $E$ in terms of projection onto $OA$, this suggests $D$ is on the ray $AE$ beyond $E$.\nIf $A=(R, 0)$ and $E=(R, 6)$, then $D=(R, y_D)$.\nIf $D$ is on the ray $AE$, $y_D > 6$. Then $AD = y_D$. $DE = y_D - 6$. $AE = 6$. $AD = AE + DE$.\nIf $D$ is on the ray $EA$ beyond $A$, $y_D < 0$. Then $AD = -y_D$. $DE = 6 - y_D$. $AE = 6$. $DE = DA + AE$.\n\nIf $D$ is on the ray $AE$ (i.e., $A$ is between $O$ and $D$ in terms of projection on $OA$), then $D$ is further from $O$ than $A$. This is true since $OD > R$.\nIf $D$ is on the ray $AE$, then $D$ is on the same side of $A$ as $E$. $y_D > 0$.\nSince $OD > OE$, $y_D^2 > 6^2$, so $|y_D| > 6$.\nSince $y_D > 0$, $y_D > 6$.\nSo $D$ is on the ray $AE$ beyond $E$.\n$AD = y_D$. $AE=6$. $DE = y_D - 6$. $AD = AE + DE$. This is consistent.\n$DA = y_D = \\sqrt{OD^2 - R^2} = DB$. Wait, this is wrong. $D$ is not on the circle.\n\n$D$ is on the line $AE$. $OA \\perp AE$. $\\triangle OAD$ is a right triangle at $A$.\n$OD^2 = OA^2 + AD^2 = R^2 + AD^2$.\n$AD^2 = OD^2 - R^2 = DB^2$.\n$AD^2 = \\frac{50625}{484}$.\n$AD = \\sqrt{\\frac{50625}{484}} = \\frac{225}{22}$.\n\nSince $AD = DB$, $\\triangle ABD$ is isosceles.\nWe have $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\nSince $AD = 225/22$, we have:\n$\\left(\\frac{225}{22}\\right)^2 = \\frac{225}{22} \\cdot DP$.\n$DP = \\frac{225}{22}$.\n\nSince $AD = DP$, $A$ must be the midpoint of $DP$. This means $AD=DP$.\nIf $A$ is the midpoint of $DP$, then $A$ is between $D$ and $P$.\n$AP = AD + DP = 2 AD$. Wait, $A, P$ are on the circle. $D$ is outside.\n$D, A, P$ are collinear. $D$ is outside. $A, P$ are on $\\omega$.\nThe power of $D$ is $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\nIf $DA=DP$, then $DB^2 = DA^2$. This is consistent with $AD=DB=225/22$.\n\nIf $DA=DP$, then $A$ is the midpoint of the segment $DP$.\n$AP = |DA - DP|$ if $D$ is between $A$ and $P$, which is impossible since $D$ is outside.\nIf $A$ is between $D$ and $P$, then $DP = DA + AP$.\n$DA = DP$ implies $AP=0$, so $A=P$. This means $AD$ is tangent to $\\omega$ at $A$.\nIf $AD$ is tangent at $A$, then $AD \\perp OA$. This is true since $AD$ lies on the line $AE$ and $OA \\perp AE$.\n\nIf $AD$ is tangent at $A$, then $P=A$. $AP=0$. This is not of the form $m/n$ unless $m=0$.\nIf $P=A$, then $AD$ is tangent to $\\omega$ at $A$.\nIf $AD$ is tangent at $A$, then $D$ must lie on the tangent line at $A$. We established this: $D$ lies on $AE$, and $AE$ is the tangent line at $A$.\n\nIf $P=A$, then $AP=0$. $m=0, n=1$. $m+n=1$. This seems too simple for an AIME problem, and $AP$ is usually positive.\n\nLet's re-examine the power of a point $D$. $D$ is outside $\\omega$.\nThe line $AD$ intersects $\\omega$ at $A$ and $P$.\nThe power of $D$ is $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\nIf $D$ is outside, the points are ordered $D, A, P$ or $D, P, A$.\nIf $D, A, P$ is the order, $DP = DA + AP$. $DB^2 = DA(DA+AP)$.\nIf $D, P, A$ is the order, $DA = DP + PA$. $DB^2 = DP(DP+PA)$.\n\nIf $AD$ is tangent at $A$, then $P=A$. $DP=DA$. $DB^2 = DA^2$. This is consistent with $AD=DB=225/22$.\nIf $P=A$, then $AP=0$.\n\nLet's check if $AD$ must be tangent at $A$.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$. $AD$ is the symmedian.\nThe symmedian $AD$ is tangent to the circumcircle at $A$ if and only if $c^2=b^2$, i.e., $AB=AC$.\nHere $c=5, b=10$. $c \\neq b$. So $AD$ is not tangent at $A$. Thus $P \\neq A$.\n\nIf $AD$ is not tangent, then $D, A, P$ are distinct points on the line $AD$.\nSince $D$ is outside, $A$ and $P$ are on the circle.\nThe line $AD$ is a secant line.\nThe order must be $D, A, P$ or $D, P, A$.\n\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, it is known that the symmedian $AD$ intersects the circumcircle at $P$ such that $AP$ is related to $R$.\n\nLet's use the property that $AD$ is the symmedian.\nThe symmedian $s_a$ divides the angle $A$ such that $\\angle BAs_a = \\angle CAM$ and $\\angle CAs_a = \\angle BAM$.\nLet $\\angle DAB = \\alpha$ and $\\angle DAC = \\gamma$. $A = \\alpha + \\gamma$ since $E$ is internal.\n\nSince $AD$ is the symmedian, it is known that the line $AD$ intersects the circumcircle at $P$ such that $AP$ is related to the lengths $b, c$.\nIt is known that $AP = \\frac{2bc \\cos A}{b+c}$ if $AD$ were the angle bisector.\n\nFor the symmedian $AD$, it is known that $AP = \\frac{2bc \\cos A}{b+c}$ is not correct.\n\nLet's use the property that $AD$ is the symmedian.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian. Let $s_a$ be the symmedian length $AE=26/5$.\nLet $t_A$ be the tangent at $A$. Let $K=t_A \\cap BC$. We found $K=E$ and $AE=6$.\nSince $D, A, E$ are collinear, $D$ lies on the tangent line $t_A$.\nIf $D$ lies on the tangent line at $A$, then $DA$ is the distance from $D$ to $A$ along the tangent line.\nSince $D$ is outside $\\omega$, $DA$ is the length of the tangent segment from $D$ to $A$.\nIf $D$ is on the tangent line at $A$, then $DA$ is the length of the tangent segment from $D$ to $A$.\nThis means $DB^2 = DA^2$. This is what we found: $AD = DB = 225/22$.\n\nIf $D$ is on the tangent line at $A$, then $AD$ is tangent to $\\omega$ at $A$.\nThis implies $P=A$, so $AP=0$. This contradicts $c \\neq b$.\n\nWhere is the error?\n1. $AD$ is the symmedian. (Correct)\n2. $E = AD \\cap BC$. $E$ must be internal since $c \\neq b$. $AE=26/5$. (Correct based on symmedian definition)\n3. $K = t_A \\cap BC$. $K$ lies on $AD$. So $E=K$. (Correct)\n4. If $E=K$, $E$ must be external to $BC$ for $EA^2$ to be the power of $E$. (Correct)\n5. If $E$ is external, $AE=6$. (Correct based on power of point)\n\nContradiction: $AE=26/5$ and $AE=6$. $26/5 = 5.2$. $6$.\n\nLet's re-examine the property: The symmedian $s_a$ passes through $K = t_A \\cap BC$.\nThis property is correct. $AD$ is the symmedian, so $D$ lies on $t_A$.\nIf $D$ lies on $t_A$, then $DA$ is a segment of the tangent line at $A$.\nIf $D$ is outside $\\omega$, then $DA$ is the length of the tangent segment from $D$ to $A$.\nThe power of $D$ is $DB^2 = DA^2$. This implies $AD=DB=225/22$.\n\nIf $DA$ is tangent at $A$, then $P=A$, so $AP=0$.\n\nLet's check the condition for $AD$ to be the symmedian.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$. $AD$ is the symmedian. This is a standard result.\n\nLet's check the condition for $K=t_A \\cap BC$ to lie on $AD$. This is also a standard result.\n\nIf $D$ lies on the tangent at $A$, then $AD$ is tangent at $A$. $P=A$. $AP=0$.\n\nIf $AP=0$, then $m=0, n=1$, $m+n=1$.\n\nLet's assume $AP \\neq 0$ and re-evaluate the collinearity of $D, A, E$.\n$E = AD \\cap BC$. $E$ is the intersection of the symmedian and $BC$.\n$K = t_A \\cap BC$. $K$ is the intersection of the tangent at $A$ and $BC$.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian. $K$ lies on the symmedian $AD$. So $K$ lies on the line $AD$.\nSince $E$ is defined as the intersection of line $AD$ and line $BC$, and $K$ is the intersection of line $t_A$ and line $BC$, and $D$ is on $t_B \\cap t_C$, and $A, B, C$ are on $\\omega$.\n\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian. The line $AK$ is the symmedian. So $D$ lies on $AK$.\nSince $E$ is on $AD$ and $BC$, and $K$ is on $AK$ and $BC$, and $A, D, K$ are collinear, $E=K$.\n\nSo $E$ must be the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$.\nIf $E$ is the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$, then $E$ must be external to $BC$ for $EA^2$ to be the power of $E$.\nIf $E$ is external, $AE=6$.\nIf $E$ is external, the symmedian $AD$ divides $BC$ externally in ratio $c^2/b^2$. $AE=6$. This is consistent.\n\nSo $AE=6$ is correct. $E$ is outside $\\omega$. $D$ is outside $\\omega$. $A$ is on $\\omega$.\nSince $D$ is on the line $AE$, and $AE$ is tangent at $A$, $D$ is on the tangent line at $A$.\nThis implies $AD$ is tangent at $A$, so $P=A$, $AP=0$.\n\nLet's check the theorem: $D=t_B \\cap t_C$. $AD$ is the symmedian.\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, it intersects the circumcircle at $P$.\nIf $AD$ is tangent at $A$, then $c=b$. Here $c=5, b=10$. So $AD$ is not tangent. $P \\neq A$.\n\nIf $AD$ is not tangent, then $D$ cannot lie on the tangent line at $A$.\nThis means $E$ cannot be the intersection of $t_A$ and $BC$.\nThis means the theorem \"The symmedian from $A$ passes through $K = t_A \\cap BC$\" is false, or my interpretation of $D$ being on $t_A$ is wrong.\n\nLet $t_A$ be the tangent at $A$. $K = t_A \\cap BC$.\nThe line $AK$ is the symmedian. Since $AD$ is the symmedian, $D$ must lie on $AK$.\nSo $D, A, K$ are collinear.\nSince $E = AD \\cap BC$, and $K$ is on $BC$, $E$ must be $K$.\nSo $E=K$. This implies $AE=6$.\n\nIf $AE=6$, then $D$ lies on the line $AE$, which is the tangent line $t_A$.\nIf $D$ lies on $t_A$, then $DA$ is tangent at $A$. $P=A$. $AP=0$.\n\nLet's check the condition for $AD$ to be the symmedian.\n$D$ is the intersection of tangents at $B$ and $C$.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian if and only if $D$ is the pole of $BC$. This is true by definition of $D$.\n\nLet's check the condition for $AD$ to be tangent at $A$.\n$AD$ is tangent at $A$ iff $c=b$. Since $c \\neq b$, $AD$ is not tangent. $P \\neq A$.\n\nIf $AD$ is not tangent, $D$ cannot lie on the tangent line $t_A$.\nThis means $D$ is not on the line $AE=t_A$.\nThis means $A$ is not on the line $DE$.\nThis means $E \\neq K$.\n\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, $D$ lies on $AK$. $A, D, K$ are collinear.\n$E$ is the intersection of $AD$ and $BC$. $K$ is the intersection of $AK$ and $BC$.\nSince $A, D, K$ are collinear, the line $AD$ is the same as the line $AK$.\nThus $E=K$. This forces $AE=6$.\n\nThe only way out is if the theorem that $AD$ is the symmedian is false, or the theorem that $AD$ passes through $K$ is false. Both are standard results in triangle geometry.\n\nLet's assume $AD$ is NOT the symmedian, but $D$ is still $t_B \\cap t_C$.\nThe line $AD$ is called the \"anti-symmedian\" or something else.\n\nLet's use the property $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$ and $AD^2 = OD^2 - R^2$.\nWe found $AD = DB = 225/22$.\n$DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP \\implies DA^2 = DA \\cdot DP$. Since $DA \\neq 0$, $DP = DA$.\n$DP = DA = 225/22$.\n\nIf $D$ is outside, the order is $D, A, P$ or $D, P, A$.\nIf $D, A, P$: $DP = DA + AP$. $DA = DA + AP \\implies AP=0$.\nIf $D, P, A$: $DA = DP + PA$. $DA = DA + PA \\implies PA=0$.\n\nThis strongly suggests $P=A$, so $AP=0$.\n\nLet's re-read the problem statement carefully. $AB=5, BC=9, AC=10$. $D=t_B \\cap t_C$. $AD$ intersects $\\omega$ at $P$.\nIf $AP=0$, then $m=0, n=1$, $m+n=1$.\n\nLet's search for a counterexample where $AD$ is the symmedian but $AD \\neq DB$.\n$AD=DB$ implies $\\triangle ABD$ is isosceles.\n$AD^2 = OD^2 - R^2$. $DB^2 = OD^2 - R^2$. This is always true because $D$ is the pole of $BC$.\n$AD^2 = DB^2$ is always true if $A$ is on the circle and $D$ is the pole of $BC$.\nWait, $A$ is on the circle. $D$ is the pole of $BC$. $DB$ is tangent length. $DA$ is the distance from $D$ to $A$.\n$DB^2$ is the power of $D$. $DA \\cdot DP$ is the power of $D$.\n$DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\n\nIf $AD=DB$, then $DA^2 = DA \\cdot DP$, so $DA=DP$. This implies $P=A$.\n\nWhy is $AD=DB$ always true?\n$D$ is the pole of $BC$. $O, M, D$ are collinear. $OM \\cdot OD = R^2$.\n$DB^2 = OD^2 - R^2$.\n$AD^2 = OD^2 - OA^2$ only if $AD \\perp OA$.

No.\n\nLet $k$ be the ratio $AP/AD$. $P$ is on the circle, $D$ is outside. $A$ is on the circle.\n$P$ is between $A$ and $D$ or $A$ is between $P$ and $D$.\nSince $D$ is outside, the order is $D, P, A$ or $D, A, P$.\n\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, then $AP = \\frac{2bc \\cos A}{b^2+c^2} \\cdot \\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2R}$ is not correct.\n\nLet's use the known formula for the length of the segment of the symmedian inside the circle.\nIf $AD$ is the symmedian, $AP = \\frac{2bc}{b^2+c^2} \\cdot m_a \\cdot \\frac{2R}{m_a}$?

No.\n\nLet's use the power of $D$: $DB^2 = DA \\cdot DP$.\nWe need $DA$. $D$ is the pole of $BC$. $A$ is a point on the circle.\n$DA$ is the distance from the pole to $A$.\n\nLet $d_A$ be the distance $DA$.\nThe distance from the pole $D$ to a point $A$ on the circle is given by:\n$d_A^2 = OD^2 + R^2 - 2R \\cdot OD \\cos(\\angle AOD)$.\n\nLet's use the property that $AD$ is the symmedian.\nThe line $AD$ is the symmedian. Let $s_a$ be the length of the symmedian segment $AE=26/5$.\nThe ratio $AD/AE$ is related to $R$.\n\nLet $d_A = DA$. $d_A = \\frac{R^2}{R \\cos(\\angle AOD) - OM \\cos(\\angle AOM)}$? Too complicated.\n\nLet's use the result that $AD$ is the symmedian.\nThe length of the chord $AP$ cut by the symmedian $AD$ is given by:\n$AP = \\frac{2bc}{b^2+c^2} \\cdot \\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{2R} \\cdot \\frac{2R}{m_a}$? No.\n\nLet $k = AP/AD$. $DP = DA + AP$ or $DA = DP + AP$.\nIf $D, A, P$ order: $DP = DA + AP$. $DB^2 = DA(DA+AP) = DA^2 + DA \\cdot AP$.\n$AP = \\frac{DB^2 - DA^2}{DA}$.\n\nIf $D, P, A$ order: $DA = DP + AP$. $DB^2 = DP(DP+AP)$.\n$DP = \\frac{DB^2}{DA}$. $DA = \\frac{DB^2}{DA} + AP$.\n$AP = DA - \\frac{DB^2}{DA} = \\frac{DA^2 - DB^2}{DA}$.\n\nWe need to find $DA$.\nSince $AD$ is the symmedian, the ratio $AP/AD$ is known.\n$AP = \\frac{2bc}{b^2+c^2} \\cdot \\frac{2R \\sin A}{\\sin(\\angle APD)}$? No.\n\nLet's use the known formula for the length of the chord $AP$ cut by the symmedian $AD$:\n$AP = \\frac{2bc}{b^2+c^2} \\cdot 2R \\sin A$.
