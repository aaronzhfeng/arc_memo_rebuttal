["Solve this AIME problem:\n\nIn $\\triangle ABC$ with $AB=AC,$ point $D$ lies strictly between $A$ and $C$ on side $\\overline{AC},$ and point $E$ lies strictly between $A$ and $B$ on side $\\overline{AB}$ such that $AE=ED=DB=BC.$ The degree measure of $\\angle ABC$ is $\\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n\nOutput only the integer answer, and wrap it exactly once as \\boxed{XYZ}.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Mention intermediate numbers only inside sentences/equations so they are not mistaken for answers.\n- Do not use \\boxed anywhere else in the response.\n- The grader will read the boxed integer wherever it appears."]
