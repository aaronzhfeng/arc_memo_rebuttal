["### Introduction\n\nYou are analyzing AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) problems to extract reusable mathematical reasoning patterns. AIME problems span algebra, geometry, number theory, combinatorics, and probability, and are typically solvable with high-school level contest techniques.\n\nYour task is to analyze a solved problem and its reasoning process to extract reusable lessons for solving other AIME problems. These lessons should be phrased as problem-solving \"rules\" that describe:\n\n- a **situation** (what structural pattern to recognize), and\n- a **suggestion** (what concrete technique to try).\n\n### Instructions\n\nWe will provide you with a problem answer and the solver's reasoning process.\n\nYour job is to output ONLY a markdown YAML block containing 2–5 lessons, each of the form:\n\n```yaml\n- situation: [mathematical pattern or condition to recognize]\n  suggestion: [technique or approach to try]\n```\n\nNo extra prose, no headings, no explanation outside the YAML list.\n\nDesign the lessons with the following constraints:\n\n1. **General but Detectable Situations**\n   - Describe structural patterns, not specific numbers.\n   - Parameterize values: e.g. say \"when two overlapping products share a variable and their constants are coprime\" instead of \"when abc=70 and cde=71.\"\n   - It is acceptable to mention qualitative properties like \"prime,\" \"perfect square,\" \"consecutive integers,\" \"equally spaced points,\" \"similar triangles,\" etc.\n\n2. **Concrete, Executable Suggestions**\n   - Each *suggestion* must describe specific mathematical actions a capable student could carry out: introduce a variable, write a recurrence, apply similarity, set up a system, use the shoelace formula, count lattice points, etc.\n   - Avoid vague advice like \"analyze carefully,\" \"be systematic,\" or \"consider symmetry\" unless you immediately follow it with a concrete procedure.\n   - At least **one** lesson must encode the **main key step** from the solution in an explicit way (for example, \"define P(k) as … and write a recurrence P(k) = …\", or \"view each k-digit block of 9s as 10^k − 1 and sum these as a geometric series\").\n\n3. **AIME-Level Methods Only**\n   - Use tools appropriate for AIME: algebraic manipulation, inequalities, modular arithmetic, recurrences, casework, combinatorial counting, similarity, Pythagorean triples, coordinate geometry, area/ratio arguments, parity, basic number theory (gcd/lcm, prime factorization, divisor-count formulas), etc.\n   - Do NOT invoke heavy or unnecessary methods such as Fourier analysis, character sums, measure theory, advanced group theory, or anything beyond typical high-school olympiad/AIME level.\n\n4. **Avoid Problem-Specific Overfitting**\n   - Do not refer to problem labels, specific variable names from the statement, or the problem's numerical constants.\n   - Do NOT restate the original problem in disguise.\n   - Ask yourself: \"Would this lesson still be useful if all the numbers were changed but the structure stayed the same?\" If not, generalize it.\n\n5. **No Trivial or Meta Advice**\n   - Do not include lessons like \"re-read the problem,\" \"check your arithmetic,\" or \"answer the question at the end.\"\n   - Focus only on *mathematical structure* and *methods*.\n\n6. **Faithfulness to the Given Solution**\n   - Base your lessons on actual reasoning steps visible in the solver's process.\n   - You may compress, reorganize, or generalize those steps, but do not invent fundamentally different solution methods that are not suggested by the reasoning.\n   - If the reasoning describes a correction of a previous error, formulate the lesson as the correct strategy (and optionally a brief warning of the pitfall) in general terms.\n\n### Examples\n#### Example 1\n##### Example 1 Reflection\n\n##### Example 1 Lesson(s)\n```yaml\n- situation: \"When an integer is formed by summing or concatenating long blocks of identical digits (like many 9s) and you are asked about its decimal form or digit sum.\"\n  suggestion: \"Express each repeated-digit block using powers of the base (for example as combinations of 10^k and 1), combine them with geometric-series algebra, and then interpret the resulting expression back in base 10 to see the digit pattern.\"\n- situation: \"When you have an algebraic expression for a large integer and need only its digit pattern or digit sum, especially after simplifying sums of repeated-digit numbers.\"\n  suggestion: \"Rewrite the number into a form that is close to a string of all 0s, 1s, or 9s and then analyze the necessary carries or borrows systematically to determine long stretches of identical digits and compute the digit sum without full expansion.\"\n```\n\n#### Example 2\n##### Example 2 Reflection\n\n##### Example 2 Lesson(s)\n```yaml\n- situation: \"When two numbers are chosen from a finite consecutive integer range and the condition depends only on their difference or which one is larger.\"\n  suggestion: \"Model all outcomes as ordered pairs on an integer grid, describe the region that satisfies the inequality (or its complement) as a simple band or triangle, and count lattice points in that region to obtain the probability.\"\n```\n\n#### Example 3\n##### Example 3 Reflection\n\n##### Example 3 Lesson(s)\n```yaml\n- situation: \"When a triangle with convenient side lengths (such as a scaled Pythagorean triple) has points marked at fixed distances along its sides and you need areas or coordinates of interior polygons.\"\n  suggestion: \"Place the triangle in a coordinate system so key sides lie on the axes, parametrize points on the sides by their fractional distances from the vertices, and compute their coordinates explicitly.\"\n- situation: \"When the vertices of a polygon are known in coordinates and the task is to find its area, especially inside a larger triangle.\"\n  suggestion: \"Use a coordinate-area method such as the shoelace formula, or decompose the polygon into simpler triangles and rectangles, to calculate the area directly from the vertex coordinates.\"\n```\n\n\n### Problem Answer\n73\n\n### Solver's Reasoning\n['The solver’s “answer’’ of 73 has no justification and is simply not correct.  In fact one can show by a straightforward (if a bit lengthy) trigonometric or even coordinate‐geometry calculation that\\n\\n∠ABC = x = 3π/7 radians = (180·3/7)° = 540/7°, \\n\\nso that m=540, n=7, and m+n=547.  Below is one way to see it.\\n\\n1)  Set AB=AC=1 and let ∠ABC=∠ACB=x.  Then ∠BAC=180°–2x.  \\n   By the Law of Cosines in ΔABC,\\n     BC² = 1²+1²–2·1·1·cos(180°–2x)  = 2–2·(–cos2x) = 2+2cos2x  = 4cos²x,\\n   so\\n     BC = 2\\u2009cos\\u2009x.\\n\\n2)  Mark points E on AB and D on AC so that\\n     AE = ED = DB = BC = 2\\u2009cos\\u2009x.\\n   Since AB=1, AE = 2\\u2009cos\\u2009x must be ≤1, so cos\\u2009x ≤½ ⇒ x ≥60°, which is consistent with what we will find.\\n\\n3)  Coordinates.  Place\\n     A=(0,0),  B=(1,0),\\n     C=(cos\\u2009(180°–2x),\\u2009sin\\u2009(180°–2x)) = (–cos2x,\\u2009+sin2x).\\n   Then\\n     E = (AE,0) = (2\\u2009cos\\u2009x,0),\\n     D lies on AC, so write D = u·C = (–u\\u2009cos2x,\\u2009u\\u2009sin2x) for some 0<u<1.\\n\\n4)  The conditions ED=BC and DB=BC give two equations in u and x.  Subtracting them forces\\n     1 + 2cos\\u2009x + 2u\\u2009cos2x = 0\\n   so\\n     u = –(1+2cos\\u2009x)/(2cos2x).\\n    Plugging back into, say, DB=2\\u2009cos\\u2009x leads after a bit of algebra to the single equation\\n     64c⁶+32c⁵–64c⁴–32c³+12c²+4c–1 = 0,\\n   where c=cos\\u2009x.\\n\\n5)  One checks (or else recognizes the minimal polynomial of) \\n     c = cos\\u2009(3π/7) = cos\\u2009(540/7°)\\n   is indeed a root in the interval (0,½].  3π/7 radians = 540/7° ≃77.14°, giving cos\\u2009x ≃0.2225.\\n\\n6)  Therefore \\n     ∠ABC = x = 540/7°,\\n   so \\n     m = 540,  n = 7,  gcd(m,n)=1,  and \\n     m + n = 540 + 7 = 547.\\n\\nAnswer: 547.']\n"]
