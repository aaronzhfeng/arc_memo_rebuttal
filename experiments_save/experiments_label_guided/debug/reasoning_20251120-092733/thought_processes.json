{"2020-I-1":["The solver’s “answer’’ of 73 has no justification and is simply not correct.  In fact one can show by a straightforward (if a bit lengthy) trigonometric or even coordinate‐geometry calculation that\n\n∠ABC = x = 3π/7 radians = (180·3/7)° = 540/7°, \n\nso that m=540, n=7, and m+n=547.  Below is one way to see it.\n\n1)  Set AB=AC=1 and let ∠ABC=∠ACB=x.  Then ∠BAC=180°–2x.  \n   By the Law of Cosines in ΔABC,\n     BC² = 1²+1²–2·1·1·cos(180°–2x)  = 2–2·(–cos2x) = 2+2cos2x  = 4cos²x,\n   so\n     BC = 2 cos x.\n\n2)  Mark points E on AB and D on AC so that\n     AE = ED = DB = BC = 2 cos x.\n   Since AB=1, AE = 2 cos x must be ≤1, so cos x ≤½ ⇒ x ≥60°, which is consistent with what we will find.\n\n3)  Coordinates.  Place\n     A=(0,0),  B=(1,0),\n     C=(cos (180°–2x), sin (180°–2x)) = (–cos2x, +sin2x).\n   Then\n     E = (AE,0) = (2 cos x,0),\n     D lies on AC, so write D = u·C = (–u cos2x, u sin2x) for some 0<u<1.\n\n4)  The conditions ED=BC and DB=BC give two equations in u and x.  Subtracting them forces\n     1 + 2cos x + 2u cos2x = 0\n   so\n     u = –(1+2cos x)/(2cos2x).\n    Plugging back into, say, DB=2 cos x leads after a bit of algebra to the single equation\n     64c⁶+32c⁵–64c⁴–32c³+12c²+4c–1 = 0,\n   where c=cos x.\n\n5)  One checks (or else recognizes the minimal polynomial of) \n     c = cos (3π/7) = cos (540/7°)\n   is indeed a root in the interval (0,½].  3π/7 radians = 540/7° ≃77.14°, giving cos x ≃0.2225.\n\n6)  Therefore \n     ∠ABC = x = 540/7°,\n   so \n     m = 540,  n = 7,  gcd(m,n)=1,  and \n     m + n = 540 + 7 = 547.\n\nAnswer: 547."]}
