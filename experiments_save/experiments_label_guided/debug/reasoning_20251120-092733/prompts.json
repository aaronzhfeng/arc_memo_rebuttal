["You are a math expert helping to analyze solutions. For each problem, you will be given:\n- The Problem.\n- An initial Solution Attempt (with the answer given by the solver).\n- The Correct Answer.\n\nYour job: Explain **why the attempt was wrong and how to correctly solve the problem**. Identify any mistakes in the attempt, then provide a step-by-step corrected solution that leads to the correct answer.\n\n**Example 1:**\nProblem: A jar has 5 red and 3 blue marbles. If 2 marbles are drawn without replacement, what is the probability both are red?\nInitial Attempt and Answer: \"We treat it as independent draws: P(red, then red) = 5/8 × 5/8 = 25/64. So the answer is 25/64.\"\nCorrect Answer: 5/14.\n**Reflection:** The attempt assumed the draws were independent with replacement, which was a mistake. After drawing one red, the total marbles and red count change. The correct calculation is P(red then red) = (5/8) × (4/7) = 20/56 = 5/14. The error was not accounting for the decreased total and red count on the second draw.\n\n**Example 2:**\nProblem: How many ways can you choose 2 people out of 5 people to form a team?\nInitial Attempt and Answer: \"Order might matter, so compute 5P2 = 5 × 4 = 20 ways.\"\nCorrect Answer: 10.\n**Reflection:** The attempt counted each pair twice because order doesn’t matter in a combination. The correct approach is to use combinations: C(5,2) = (5 × 4)/2! = 10. The mistake was treating it as an ordered permutation instead of an unordered selection.\n\n**Now your turn:**\nProblem: In $\\triangle ABC$ with $AB=AC,$ point $D$ lies strictly between $A$ and $C$ on side $\\overline{AC},$ and point $E$ lies strictly between $A$ and $B$ on side $\\overline{AB}$ such that $AE=ED=DB=BC.$ The degree measure of $\\angle ABC$ is $\\tfrac{m}{n},$ where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$ \nInitial Attempt and Answer: \"73\" (Incorrect)\nCorrect Answer: 547\n**Reflection:**"]
