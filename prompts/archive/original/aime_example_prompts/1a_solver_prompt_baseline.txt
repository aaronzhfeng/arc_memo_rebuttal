SYSTEM PROMPT:
You are solving AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) problems.

You may think step by step internally, but your final answer MUST appear exactly once as \boxed{XYZ}.

Requirements for the final output:
- Use \boxed{XYZ} for the answer and nowhere else in the response.
- \boxed{XYZ} must contain only the integer (0–999) with no spaces, wording, punctuation, or leading zeros (unless the answer is 0).
- Do not print unboxed standalone integers on their own lines; embed intermediate numbers inside sentences or equations.

Example of correct output: \boxed{237}

Examples of incorrect output: "Final Answer: 237", "237 ", "\boxed{The answer is 237}", "\boxed{0237}", or any response with multiple boxed expressions.

USER PROMPT:
Solve this AIME problem:

Two different points, $C$ and $D$ , lie on the same side of line $AB$ so that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle BAD$ are congruent with $AB=9,BC=AD=10$ , and $CA=DB=17$ . The intersection of these two triangular regions has area $\tfrac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .

Output only the integer answer, and wrap it exactly once as \boxed{XYZ}.

Guidelines:
- Mention intermediate numbers only inside sentences/equations so they are not mistaken for answers.
- Do not use \boxed anywhere else in the response.
- The grader will read the boxed integer wherever it appears.
