  "reasoning": "Here is a concise, high\u2010level outline of how one arrives at the answer without exposing every private detail of my scratch work:\n\n1.  Model the picture in the plane.  Place  \n    A = (0,0) and B = (9,0).  \n\n2.  Locate C and D by using the Law of Cosines to get their coordinates.  \n    \u2013  From triangle ABC with sides 9, 10, 17 one finds  \n       C = (15, 8).  \n    \u2013  From triangle BAD with sides 9, 10, 17 one finds  \n       D = (\u20136, 8).  \n    Both C and D lie above the x\u2013axis (the line AB).\n\n3.  Observe that the intersection of the two triangular regions \u0394ABC and \u0394BAD is exactly the set of points that lie  \n    (i) above AB,  \n    (ii) below the line AC, and  \n    (iii) below the line BD.  \n    Geometrically one checks that over the interval x\u2208[0,9] the \u201clower\u201d of those two roof\u2010lines is first AC from A up to the crossing point P, then BD from P back down to B.  In fact AC and BD meet exactly once in the interior; call that point P.\n\n4.  Compute P = AC \u2229 BD by setting up parametric equations for the two segments.  One finds  \n    P = (4.5, 2.4).\n\n5.  Conclude that the overlapping region is the triangle with vertices A, B, and P.  Its area is  \n    area = \u00bd\u00b7AB\u00b7(height at P) = \u00bd\u00b79\u00b7(2.4) = 10.8 = 54/5.  \n\n6.  Hence the intersection\u2010area is 54/5, so m+n = 54+5 = 59.\n\nThat completes the key ideas:  \n\u2022  Coordinate placement to simplify the side\u2010length conditions.  \n\u2022  Law of Cosines to find C and D.  \n\u2022  Identifying that the overlap is the \u201clower envelope\u201d under two lines above the common base.  \n\u2022  Finding their intersection P and seeing the overlap is just \u0394ABP.  \n\u2022  Computing its area in one step."
