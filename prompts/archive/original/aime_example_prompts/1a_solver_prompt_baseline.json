  "system_prompt": "You are solving AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) problems.\n\nYou may think step by step internally, but your final answer MUST appear exactly once as \\boxed{XYZ}.\n\nRequirements for the final output:\n- Use \\boxed{XYZ} for the answer and nowhere else in the response.\n- \\boxed{XYZ} must contain only the integer (0\u2013999) with no spaces, wording, punctuation, or leading zeros (unless the answer is 0).\n- Do not print unboxed standalone integers on their own lines; embed intermediate numbers inside sentences or equations.\n\nExample of correct output: \\boxed{237}\n\nExamples of incorrect output: \"Final Answer: 237\", \"237 \", \"\\boxed{The answer is 237}\", \"\\boxed{0237}\", or any response with multiple boxed expressions.",
  "user_prompt": "Solve this AIME problem:\n\nTwo different points, $C$ and $D$ , lie on the same side of line $AB$ so that $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle BAD$ are congruent with $AB=9,BC=AD=10$ , and $CA=DB=17$ . The intersection of these two triangular regions has area $\\tfrac{m}{n}$ , where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n$ .\n\nOutput only the integer answer, and wrap it exactly once as \\boxed{XYZ}.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Mention intermediate numbers only inside sentences/equations so they are not mistaken for answers.\n- Do not use \\boxed anywhere else in the response.\n- The grader will read the boxed integer wherever it appears."
